All these activities have been happening for the past four years and are still ongoing, causing rapid deterioration. The highly threatened IBA is a sewage pond on the outskirts of the capital city Gaborone. On identification as an IBA, it was well managed, fenced and supported large numbers of Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa).However, over the years it was less prioritised by Gaborone City Council, then people vandalised the fence and dumped domestic as well as industrial waste. Livestock from neighbouring settlements invaded the area, wild dogs and cats greatly disturbed the breeding pattern of bird hence they migrated to other water sources.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: When it was identified in 1998, Phakalane lagoons supported a wide diversity of visiting waders and other waterbirds, including both species of flamingo. Of particular note were the high numbers of Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa) particularly in the winter; usually 100â€“200 pairs, but at least 440 individuals were recorded in 1998. The site also typically supported large numbers of Southern Pochard. Small numbers of some duck breed by the lagoons whilst waterbirds, notably Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) and Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), roost on dead trees. State of the habitats of the trigger species: These are four rectangular sewage treatment lagoons (with at least 70 ha of water) built in Gaborone North close to Phakalane residential area. They are in a grassland area, surrounded by Acacia savanna. The site lies adjacent to the Ngotwane River. Riparian vegetation along this section of the Ngotwane is dominated by Bushwillow trees (Combretum) and there are some open areas of wet grassland. The ponds are used by waterfowl which frequently move from one dam or sewage pond to another.","The site is a sewage pond, where all systems in the city deposits , it is supposed to be fenced and managed by Gaborone City Councill as they are the authority managing sewage systems of the city.However, the ponds are abandanded and neighbouring residents use part of the place as a dumping site while pastoralists benefit from the sewage water. Birdlife could not survrive and only few species are found in the area. There are no actions planned for the site, due to the situation at the site, some conservationists have advised to delisted the site from the IBA list as it nolonger supports any trigger species.However, BirdLife members still do biannual waterfowl count at the site.",25054,confirmed,2001,,A4i,0,-,,,

The lake Abijatta has been known in the past for nearly a quarter of a million Lesser Flamingos. These numbers have appreciably gone down relative to the threats that are exacerbating the survival of species. Wattled Cranes are rare visitors while Pallid Harriers can be infrequently seen during the autumn migration. The habitat degradation and unsuitable conditions at present are do not warrant regular sightings of rare birds. State of the habitats of the trigger species: The key habitats of the site include Acacia woodlands/grasslands and alkaline lake system. The national park comprises of two alkaline lakes. The hyper-alkaline Crater Lake, Chitu, is located on the southeastern edge of the national park. Formerly the muddy shores and sandy sediment edges of the lakes constituted favourable habitat for wetland birds. Fish was also abundant and attracted a diversity of fish eating species. The habitatsof this protected area have deteriorated rapidly with the expansion of human settlements, arable agriculture, overfishing, overgrazing and mining. Mining for soda salts is conducted at a subsistence and commercial level. The high demand for fuel has depreciated the Acacia woodlands around the lake for charcoal production. The high number of cattle and goats have removed the grass cover of the site exposing the extremely fragile soils to erosion. The lake basin is endorheic with water escaping the lakes either through seepage or evaporation. The waters of Abijatta especially are known for their extremities of fluctuation. Fluctuations of Abijattaâ€™s waters are exacerbated by the abstraction of water upstream for agriculture and flower farms. The parkâ€™s habitats and the biodiversity are seriously threatened wth degradation. Loss and extinction.",A number of conservation actions are underway at the site. The Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society is leading a major campaign to conserve the site by working closely with site support groups and other members of the community. One of the efforts underway is an attempt to build the livelihoods of the community by providing income generation models and assisting them to conserve soil & water in their plots. An ecotourism project is being run by the Ethiopian Sustainable Tourism Alliance. This programme especially is trying to assist user groups to form effective tour operation facilities and personell around the site. A number of awareness and environmental education programmes are being effected to change peopleâ€™s attitudes. A draft management plan was prepared by Yilma D. Abebe during the East Africa Wetland Management training in 2003. This site has been nominated at a national level to become the countryâ€™s first Ramsar site.

Awash National Park is an island in a sea of growing human population and sugar plantations. There is heavy demand for grazing land and illegal incursions into the heart of the park has become a regular event by pastoralist Afars and Kereyou living around the site. High stocking rates have devastated large sections of the park creating denudation of vegetation. The river Awash is known to be the most developed river in Ethiopia supporting a number of irrigation schemes. The development of Awash river has brought along with it damage of riparian habitats. Heavy upstream use by agricultural development has polluted the river to a stage where fish and other water organisms die from time to time as the result of pollutant loads. On the other hand, the invasive plant Prosopis juliflora is also posing a growing threat to the natural vegetation of the area.","The parkâ€™s resources have local regional and global values. The nature of the site has depreciated in the last four decades resulting in degradation of habitats and loss of biodiversity.

State of the habitats of the trigger species: Berga is comprised of montane grasslands and wetlands. The valley bottoms are inundated annually forming marshes that form favourable habitat for the rare and endangered White-winged Flufftail. The slopes surrounding Berga floodplains have remnant indigenous Juniperus procera. The grassland and wetland habitats found in Berga are typical of highlands areas of Ethiopia found between 2450-2500 m asl.

This management plan was reviewed in 2009 to make adjustments for its implementation. However this management plan is now out of date requiring an update. A species action plan for the White-winged Flufftail exists and there are current measures to follow up its recommendations. An established local site support group is involved in a number of conservation actions amongst which their efforts to protect the marshes is significant. Local measures include constructing physical structures i.e. terraces and bunds on the slopes to arrest soil erosion. Indigenous tree species are also raised in nurseries and planted out on mountain slopes surrounding the floodplains.

The main threats are related to the destruction of its habitat rather than direct persecution. It is surmised however that predation can play a significant role in the depreciation of female birds during the incubation period. The threats described below could be the reason for its probable future extinction unless quick measures are taken. The birds breed at least twice a year but their breeding is shadowed by the fact that its habitat is destroyed by arable agriculture and encroaching acacia scrub. State of the habitats of the trigger species: The grassland habitat at the site has gradually deteriorated within the last four decades to a critical state at present. Local information describes that the grasslands on Liben plains used to be waist height at least 30 to 40 years ago. This provided excellent habitat for the Liben Lark. The grasslands are far from favourable for this critically endangered lark species.",A three year project funded by Birdfair UK is being implemented at the Dida Liben plains at present. This projects has activities that are related to the conservation of the Liben Lark and most importantly also tries to respond to the livelihood needs of the local community. A Liben Lark Conservation Committee is established with which the project works to reach the community on conservation matters. The main problem of increasing arable agriculture still requires a solution but the general consensus shows that political offices and the local community are supportive of the establishment of a reserve with special designation to protect the endangered lark. Bush encroachment is a threat to the livelihoods of pastoralists and the bird. The project has been instrumental in removing at least 400 ha of bush opening up areas for grazing and creating good habitat for the larks.,25296,confirmed,1996,,"A1, A2, A3",5467,confirmed,2011,,"Vul, Irr 1"

Actions needed,   Theres an urgent need for the review of the IBA boundary extent and identification of important grassland patches is needed; Other biodiversity of conservation significance also must be considered in deciding an action plan for the site (especially in IBAs taxonomic broadening scope); There is a need to carry out a survey to establish the extent of important grasslands and conservation threats they face at the moment; We also need to have information on threats and distribution of the two rare monkey species, and more so why they have found a suitable habitat in Busia grasslands; Suggested drawing up of a management plan and relevant key stakeholders to be involved; Establishment of an active Site Support Group to help create awareness among the local folks about the importance of their land as a habitat for the rare bird species and the potential for ecotourism; Promotion/initiation of alternative income-generating activities to sugar planting so as to reduce the rate of grassland loss to sugar farming; Writing of articles in some popular journals, posters and the local media, to highlight the status of the site as an important habitat for the Blue Swallow, and the need to conserve it, under the Blue Swallow National Action Plan project; Awareness creation in form of seminars, workshops and other forums among local farmers/people, towards the conservation of the site.

","This is a Critical Site where detailed monitoring by the local Site Support group is going on. There was a problem of squatters occupying part of the Kamae and Kieni forest blocks up to June 2003 but these have since been either resettled elsewhere or given notice to vacate by February 2004, so that the threats they posed to the forest in form of charcoal burning, subsistence horticulture and illegal logging is now considerably downscaled.    Part of the Kereita is now being surrounded by an electric fence under the larger Rhino Ark project for the Aberdare National Park. This is expected to further enhance the protection status of the forest. This electric fence is envisaged to extend throughout the forest ultimately; One of the most sensitive interior forest flagship bird species, Abbott's Starling, still abounds in this forest, as was recently revealed, indicating that the forest is not entirely irredeemable yet; KENVO has an elaborate networking strategy with other key conservation action and lobby groups including the Kenya Forest Working Group, The Greenbelt Movement and Nature Kenya that has made it easy to mobilise funding for conservation action in the forest, particularly the Kereita block.   The legal status of the forest is clearest for Kieni, Kamae and Kereita where surveillance and protection by the forest rangers is most proactive. For Kinale, Kijabe and Uplands blocks, protection appears to be only loose and infra-fragmentation is therefore intensive, only about less than 30% of indigenous forest is left in each of these three blocks.   ","Illegal logging has reduced in many parts of the forest due to increased patrols and stricter enforcement of use legislation. Most parts of Kereita block are registering considerable regeneration.   In fact there is some regeneration of saplings and most of the cut logs are old and decaying.   KENVO, in conjunction with key stakeholders to this forest, is also working to develop a draft management plan for the forest.   This is one of the six Critical Sites where a detailed monitoring scheme has been initiated by Nature Kenya and NMK with funds from the Darwin Initiative. KENVO has been trained on the techniques of the exercise and has set up a forest monitoring system that will help to constantly assess the changes in forest structure and show the levels of disturbance as well as changes in bird community. The system is using permanent sample plots (PSP) of 25x25 m along a 1 km long line transect. This project is funded partly by the BP conservation fund and partly by Nature Kenya; ICIPE has some long-term entomological monitoring in the Kereita fragment of the forest; KENVO has recently completed the second phase of the ethno-botanical studies in the Kamae block, the first phase having been done in Kereita earlier on; Otieno (Dept of Ornithology, NMK has just completed a survey of the Abbott's Starling population status in the forest",25393,confirmed,2001,,"A1, A2, A3",4164,confirmed,2011,,"Vul, Irr 1"

Turbidity and algal biomass increased rapidly throughout the 1980s, although there has been some stabilisation in the last few years (D.A. Harper, in litt.).","Annual waterbird counts show an overall decline in numbers over the years 1990â€“1997. In particular, steady and alarming declines are visible in Red-knobbed Coot, kingfishers and birds of prey (especially African Fish Eagles) (Bennun & Nasirwa, in press). The fish eagle population has halved since the 1970s. Many birds are severely under-weight, and reproductive success has declined dramatically, suggesting that the birds have problems finding sufficient food (Virani et al. 1997). As fish eagles frequently fed on coots when these were abundant at the lake (e.g. Higgins 1994), their decline may partly be connected to the decline in Red-knobbed Coot numbers. This in turn is due to the reduced area of submerged macrophytes, and also possibly to habitat loss on their breeding grounds (Bennun & Nasirwa, in press). It is unclear why kingfisher numbers are declining.","Administratively the lake is entirely within Naivasha town, but almost all the land around it is privately owned. The Ministry of Water Development and Department of Fisheries are in charge of controlling water and fish exploitation, respectively, but it is the riparian land-owners who can contribute most to management efforts. The Lake Naivasha Riparian Association was instrumental in having Naivasha declared a Ramsar site in 1995, and in drawing up a comprehensive management plan that was accepted by Government in 1997.

Unfortunately, a number of recent excisions have, for unclear reasons, targeted areas in the west, which contain the most valuable and intact tracts of closed-canopy forest. In the Eastern Mau, forest plots have recently been allocated to a reported 28,000 settlers, apparently without formal excision of the forest reserve.

The unfenced southern boundary is providing an entrance for herdsmen and illegal firewood collectors.   Wildlife abundance has increased in some portions of the park that was control-burned last year (2002), perhaps attracted by the new lush grass.The parkâ€™s dams offer an important wintering ground for migrant bird species each year.   The recent human-lion crisis in which local Maasai herdsmen in the Kitengela dispersal area killed lions in retaliation for livestock damage were quite a management challenge to the park management authorities. During May 2003 alone, 7 lions were killed, bringing to 46 the number killed on the fringes of the park over the past 4 years. These lions were trying to move after the herbivorous prey that are moving out of the park in search of fresh pastures. In fact the herdsmen began threatening to start killing the herbivores themselves, which they accused of competing with their livestock.","The number of herbivores in the park is still low as they move out into the Kitengela dispersal area to pursue more palatable pasture.Low pasture qualities are keeping herbivores out of the park for extended periods of time.    The park is intact but adjacent land's developments worrying, particularly in the Athi-Kapiti plains.   Game-viewing-based tourism has scaled down somewhat following the tendency of herbivores to disperse into the Kitengela area where the grass is more palatable. This has partially contributed to the corresponding dispersal of carnivores in the same area to seek prey, hence the herdsmen-lion conflict. Revenue to the park has also declined slightly. Remedial action including using fire as a tool to manage pasture quality are in place but it may be long before the desired state of the ecosystem is restored.    Notable current (November 2003) bird population records are: Ostriches 120; Kori Bustard 30; Secretary Bird 40).","In mid June 2003, the East African Wildlife Society mediated the conflict between the park authorities and the herdsmen in the Kitengela dispersal area to ameliorate the lion killing. As a result, there has been no escalation in the killing of the cats since then; At the mediation meeting, the Society offered to seek funds to help revive the compensation scheme, initiated by the Friends of Nairobi National Park, for livestock owners for livestock lost to livestock; The KWS itself embarked on immediately seeking out and returning to the park all lions still at large in the Kitengela area and to commence an emergency feeding programme for them.   Revival of old but abandoned human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies including: the construction of lion-proof bomas (kraals) for Maasai livestock, the FoNNAP lease scheme giving landowners financial incentive not to sell, or fence their land so as to allow wildlife some space in which to roam freely, and the strengthening of the compensation scheme against livestock losses to wildlife.

Wintering populations of Blue Swallows were confirmed again in July/August 2003.   The rare Roan Antelope and Oribi are still here in appreciable numbers, as reported by Ndang'ang'a in August 2003.   Preliminary conclusions confirm the park to be a key site for Blue Swallow wintering in east Africa (50-100 bird were sighted here during the August 2003 survey). The birds were recorded in the area between the airstrip and the Wiga Gate, characterized by open tall grassland sparsely wooded by short dry Acacia drepanolobium trees, apparently avoiding the taller healthier A. drepanolobium.  They also avoided non-wooded open areas with short grass and were not sighted anywhere between Lambwe valley and Nyatoto Gate.    To a very large extent, the park is intact and there does not seem to be a very immediate serious threat to it. There were sightings of the rare Banded Snake Eagle and the Black-backed Cisticola in the park.   Some Acacia drepanolobium tree saplings have been noticed to be drying up in the park but no one knows the cause of this as yet, although this does not seem to stop Blue Swallows from using them as perching ground.   The flagship Roan Antelope appears to have declined in population to just a third of its population over 20 years.

However, following the construction of the Diama dam at the river mouth in 1986 and the Mantali dam in Mali in 1990 the delta has dramatically changed. The dams were to supply irrigation water for agriculture to the Senegal river valley as well as creating hydroelectric power and increasing the navigable distance of the river. A large number of problems have, however, ensued; irrigated crops have proved economically unviable, increasing soil salinity is a prevalent problem and the non-agricultural activities associated with the area have suffered. Thus, livestock have had less access to water and grazing, fish stocks have declined, woodlands have been lost and water-table recharge was hampered. There have also been numerous social and health problems.  ",,"In 1994, IUCN started a programme to rehabilitate the delta working in collaboration with the management of Diawling National Park created in 1991. Using local knowledge of the functioning of the estuary the IUCN project has resulted in the rapid restoration of the hydrology of the area with dramatic results. Fish stocks have recovered pastures were restored Sporobolus grass recolonized and local women have begun earning money from making it into mats.

It is surrounded on its southern and western borders by commercial farmland; double electric boundary fences, primarily designed to keep Panthera leo and Loxodonta africana in the park and poachers and domestic animals out have been erected. This has resulted in serious disturbance to the migratory movements of ungulates. In particular, wildebeest migration was blocked by the northern fence, with a resultant decline from 25,000 to 2,300 animals in the space of 25 years. Loxodonta africana, however, still migrate out of the park in the wet season and may then create problems in adjacent commercial and communal farming areas.

The reserve is now the only formerly conserved site (This needs to be verified) where the Critically Endangered and endemic Ruddâ€™s Lark (Heteromirafra ruddi) occurs. This species requires sites with short, dense grass cover, typically with low ground cover and grass less than 0.6 m and is only known from a few locations in South Africa. Reserve management has shown an interest to manage parts of the reserve for Ruddâ€™s Lark after interactions with Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife. Inputs were made by Athol Marchant and a subsequent management plan for Ruddâ€™s Lark developed (Marchant 2011). This presents a unique opportunity to manage the reserve for this species and reserve staff should be encouraged and supported to implement these recommendations. The area is also important for other grassland species such as Yellow-breasted Pipit and Mountain Pipit and these species could further benefit from careful management of the site. Species such as Drakensberg Rock-jumper and Drakensberg Siskin also occur and are associated with rocky outcrops and other refugia. Priority species at the site are not easily monitored or identified and most have not been recorded during SABAP2 such as Ruddâ€™s Lark and many Pipit species.

The proximity of the kafue Flats to Lusaka and its inherent demand for meat has generated significant illegal hunting and fishing industries.   poaching camps are hidden in many parts of the swamp and also within the Mimosa thickets.   The human population is increasing rapidly and each year the temporary fishing camps in the GMAs increase in number and size.,"The loss of a large part of the floodplain has reduced the number of some bird species whreas birds associated with permanent swamp appear to have increased. The creation of a permanent lagoon at Chunga in Lochinvar NP has displaced many of the lechwe and waterbirds to the east and west,outside the Pak boundaries, where they receive less protection.   recently, the artificially floods have not followed a natural pattern and changes in the ecosystem have accelerated .   In some years water levels have suddenly risen towards the end of the dry season when they would normally be receding rapidly. In such cases, the nests of some species such as the Kittlitz's plover and Common Pranticole are `destroyed.    There have also been extended periods of relatively high water, spanning several seasons creating an unnatural stable environment. many birds have benefitted from this condition as extensive wetland wetland habita becomes available throught the year, but the long effectsof this stability are probably cause for serious concern. during the same period, mimosa has spread dramatically near Lonchivar's Chunga laggon and now forms huge impenetrable thickets. if it continues to spread at the current rate, vast areas of the floodplain and shoreline could soon be covered rendering it unsuitable for most waterbirds, the Kafue Lechwe, Ila-tonga cattle grazing and tourism.   The controlled flooding has reduced the number of very high floods resulting to the termitaria zone that has spread.this gradually progresses to woodland, or in many places dense thickets of thorny trees.

Most species are cut down through the orders given to a middle person. Firewood collection, which is an activity of SPPF prisoners and residents of nearby communities, became a major threat due to increasing number of people engaged. Tenure-related issues also pose threats since Mt. Siburan overlaps with F. B. Harrison Game Refuge and Bird Sanctuary within the jurisdiction of DENR. The local government of Sablayan has not been actively involved in its protection and conservation since responsibilities have not been devolved by DENR. A big portion is being claimed by the Mangyan-Batangans as their ancestral domain that will result to degradation of remaining forests in Mt. Siburan and deterioration of watershed functions. Kaingin, a traditional farming practice of the Mangyans, became unsustainable due to resource competition and limited availability of land for crop rotation. Hunting and trapping of wildlife is also practiced by the locals and trophy hunters. Bird species such as Loriculus philippensis (colasisi), hornbill (Penelopides mindorensis), and Gallicolumba platenae (bleeding heart) are captured for pet trade. Charcoal production that destroys mangroves will weaken breakwater protection and lead to loss of crustaceans and fishes, and sedimentation of coastal areas and coral reefs.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: The lowland forests of Sablayan has a high number of endemic species with at least 6 species of birds globally threatened or near threatened. The birds, Mindoro Hornbill (Penelopides mindorensis) isl isted as endangered while the Mindoro Bleeding Heart (Gallicolumba platenae) is rare and critically endangered. The other birds endemic to Sablayan and globally threatened are as follows: Mindoro Imperial Pigeon (Ducula mindorensis), Black-hooded Coucal (Centropus steeri), Scarlet-collared Flowerpecker (Dicaeum retrocinctum) and Mindoro Scops Owl (Otus mindorensis). Two mammalian species are also threatened: the Mindoro dwarf water buffalo or tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis) is critically endangered while the Golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus) is endangered. State of the habitats of the trigger species: Lowland tropical forests, with an elevation of 200-500 m, are the main source of forest products utilized for house construction, firewood, charcoal, food, timber, and medicines by the local residents and indigenous peoples. Limestone forests, with an elevation of 200-400 m, supports rich floral species with high degree of endemism. Caves are found in karst terrain and house several species of bat, birds, and crawling animals. The limestone forest provides food, firewood, timber, building materials and medicines for the Mangyans and other locals in the community. The lower montane forest is characterized by â€œbonsaiâ€ trees, about 3-meters tall, with stunted and twisted trunk and branches. Mixed lowland evergreen forests are found along the river and the lower slopes of the mountain range. Mangrove forest houses dominant plant species called Bakawan babae (Rhizophora mucronada). Wetlands are composed of lakes and rivers. In the area of Siburan lies Lake Libuao and Lake Mongpong wherein migratory birds have been observed near the former. Grasslands are characterized by 15% bamboo patches, fruit tree plantations, and cultivated fields. In Culasisi area, 70% is grassland with Integrated Social Forestry (ISF) cultivatd fields and plantation of fruit trees.

Utilization of forest resources was still intensive particularly among forest-dependent families across all forest-edge barangays whose income mainly comes from the charcoal making, gathering of non-timber forest products, wildlife hunting, and timber poaching. Farmers who are solely engaged in rice farming became charcoal producers and firewood gatherers after the rice harvest. There seems to be no other income source for them but the forest. Kaingin sites were observed in the monitoring areas. Generally, hunting of wild animals was still common among the 6 mountainside barangays. Mining and quarrying were still evident since 1940s. Small-scale electrofishing for home consumption was also reported to take place in these barangays. Freshwater fish and shells were perceived to have dwindled due to continuous use of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides in the farm that flows into the river. Water level in the creeks had also become shallow because of siltation. There was also difficulty in water supply particularly during summer.

The trend for crow honeyeaters is taken from this park. Ludovic Renaudet (SCO, Southern Lagoon + Gouldâ€™s petrel, with Julien supervision) is working on this IBA, and we should work on the crowhoneyeater by thi year so very probably with the RiviÃ¨re Bleue Park.",117539,confirmed,2007,,"A1, A2, A4ii",5058,confirmed,2010,,"Vul, Irr 1"

En este IBA existe una gran variedad de especies acuÃ¡ticas, terrestres y marinas, tanto nativas, endÃ©micas como migratorias. Sin embargo, actualmente la mayor relevancia de este IBA, en lo relativo a las aves, se debe a su condiciÃ³n de refugio natural (posiblemente el Ãºnico en toda la Isla La EspaÃ±ola-ILE- y el mundo) de Buteo ridgwayi. Esta especie, cuya poblaciÃ³n silvestre se ha estimado en alrededor de 250 individuos (http://www.peregrinefund.org/conserve_category.asp?category=West%20Indies%20Project, 2007), se encuentra En Peligro CrÃ­tico (CR) segÃºn la UniÃ³n Mundial para la Naturaleza (UICN).   Key habitats: El Parque Nacional Los Haitises se encuentra localizado entre las Provincias de Monte Plata, Hato Mayor y SamanÃ¡ en las coordenadas 19Â°01Â´N 69Â°70Â´O a una altitud de 0â€“287 metros. Tiene una extensiÃ³n de 82,600 hectÃ¡reas.  Es una de las zonas mÃ¡s lluviosas de la RepÃºblica Dominicana, con una precipitaciÃ³n anual de alrededor de 2,000 milÃ­metros. Por la diversidad de zonas de vida, es considerado un sitio â€œcomplejoâ€ que estÃ¡ conformado por Bosque Muy hÃºmedo y HÃºmedo Tropical, Bosque de Mangles, Zonas HÃºmedas, Formaciones de Roca Karst (de roca caliza) y LÃ­nea Costera. TambiÃ©n se encuentra Bosque Secundario, Cavernas o Cuevas, Zonas Cultivadas, Jardines Rurales y Ãreas Urbanas. Existen ademÃ¡s los llamados Mogotes o pequeÃ±as colinas, que son una serie de montÃ­culos (algunos incluso dentro del agua) al que muchos comparan con un envase o cartÃ³n de huevos. Estos montÃ­culos tienen una altura media entre 30 y 40 m. En el lenguaje de los taÃ­nos, antiguos pobladores de la isla, la palabra â€œhaitÃ­â€ significa â€œtierra alta o montaÃ±osaâ€, lo que es probable que de este conjunto de montÃ­culos se derive el nombre de Los Haitises. Se considera una de las zonas mÃ¡s ricas de la regiÃ³n en vegetaciÃ³n, tanto es asÃ­ que muchas especies todavÃ­a no han sido catalogadas. Posee un vasto sistema de cavernas con pictografÃ­as (escrituras) y petroglifos (grabados en piedra).  MÃºltiples estudios realizados han identificado el Karso de los Haitises como la segunda reserva de agua mÃ¡s importante de nuestra isla. En la zona kÃ¡rstica de Los Haitises tienen su origen mÃ¡s de ciento cuarenta y siete (147) arroyos y caÃ±os permanentes, de los cuales noventa (90) fluyen hacia la cuenca del RÃ­o Ozama. Los rÃ­os Ara, Comate, Comatillo, Sabita, BoyÃ¡, Yani, Piedra, Yabacao, Cevicos, Payabo y Brujuelas reciben aportes de agua de treinta y ocho (38) arroyos y manantiales de Los Haitises y que existen, ademÃ¡s, unas veintiocho (28) lagunas con agua permanente.

Agricultural practices are changing, however, with increasing cattle raising and growing of cash crops. The road to Cerro Santiago and beyond has recently been graded and asphalted, which will increase human pressure. There is also at least one huge copper deposit within the IBA, but currently the government has promised the NgÃ¤be that they will not allow a mine to be opened. This decision however may be reversed at any time.","State of key populations:  Globally threatened species include Glow-throated Hummingbird Selasphorus ardens and Yellow-green Finch Pselliophorus luteoviridis (both Vulnerable). Although neither species requires primary forest, they cannot survive if forest is completely converted to pasture. A total of 29 range-restricted species (including the two threatened species) are found in the area. Almost all of these require at least some forest habitat. Although no assessments have been done, the ongoing deforestation in the area undoubtedly has reduced the area suitable for these species. Most of the range-restricted species are birds of higher elevations that could be threatened by climate change in the long term.   State of key habitats:  Extensive areas of the lower elevations of this IBA have been deforested and converted to agriculture and cattle pasture. The rest of the forest is mostly primary montane and cloud forest with some areas of second growth where cut-and-burn subsistence agriculture has been practiced. Deforestation has occurred on both the Pacific and Caribbean slopes. To the west of Cerro Santiago, for about 8 km along the Continental Divide, the forest corridor has been severely fragmented by subsistence agriculture with potentially serious consequences with regard to continuity of populations.","The Panama Audubon Society has recently participated in a multi-disciplinary project in the same area where the forest has been fragmented, consisting of community mapping, plant collection, investigation of avifauna and investigation of the local communityâ€™s views on forests, wildlife and conservation. Although there is some awareness of the importance of conserving forest, in practice it will be extremely difficult to establish any kind of realistic and practical protected area in the near future, although as a result of the above-mentioned project there is a proposal to create such an area in the places where nobody currently lives.  The most practical way to proceed is by making information available to the community and building a sense of pride in the uniqueness and environmental services of their natural resources, perhaps coupled with nature-based tourism of the adventurous type.

There is intense pressure to develop mangroves adjacent to the city and plans to develop beach front properties further to the east. Filling in mangroves close to the city involves constructing channels to drain storm water which in turn allows runoff from city streets containing pollutants to flow directly into the ocean instead of into mangroves where they are filtered out. In rural areas, farms abut the back of mangroves removing the chance for mangroves to migrate landward with rising sea level. Agricultural runoff also may contain pollutants which may reduce prey levels in the mangroves and mudflats for fish, shrimp, and migratory shorebirds.    If future developments are allowed near the coast to the east, they may lead to more disturbance of roosting areas used by hundreds of thousands of shorebirds by people driving or walking on the beach and create more pollution if they include golf courses.   A year ago, the Supreme Court provisionally suspended the administrative resolution that created a protected area of a substantial part of this IBA. That suspension has been lifted but the government has just requested that the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention reduce the boundaries of the Ramsar Site within this IBA to allow more development in the mangroves. If this is accepted it will open the door for more wetlands destruction. The Panamanian Constitution, as well as laws and regulations protect wetlands in general but the relaxation of some of them and the lack of enforcement are also major threats to this IBA.    Climate change will lead to increased temperatures and ocean acidity which could affect the viability of prey populations for migratory shorebirds. Changes in rainfall patterns could affect the distribution of mangroves. Rising sea level will reduce the area available for mangroves if development on shore prevents them from migrating inland.","State of key populations:  The site has been designated an IBA because of its large concentrations of migratory shorebirds, especially Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri with 55% of the speciesâ€™ biogeographic population using the site as a staging or wintering area. The populations of six other species reach threshold levels at the site. More than 360,000 individuals of all shorebird species combined have been recorded at the site in a single day. A ground-based long-term monitoring program for migratory shorebirds has been initiated for the western end of the IBA. Difficulty of access and the mobility of large flocks of smaller shorebirds indicate a need for aerial surveys for more reliable data, but a regular long-term program of surveys by plane has not been started. Limited individual aerial surveys in 2004 and 2008 have not found any severe decline.   State of key habitats:  The main habitats are mangroves and intertidal mudflats. Secondary habitats include seasonally flooded wetlands behind the mangroves. Existing mangroves and mudflats are in good condition as far as is known, based on the continued presence of shorebirds, but the amount of pollutants in the sediment is unknown. However, loss of mangrove and freshwater swamps continues.","The IBA has been designated a Ramsar Site and is part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network. The site has been designated a protected area as a Wildlife Refuge by ANAM, Panamaâ€™s environmental authority, but that designation was temporarily suspended in 2012. Although this decision was reversed in 2013, the legal status of protection for the area is likely to remain under threat.   A conservation plan was published in 2013, developed by the Panama Audubon Society with the support of the US National Audubon Society through funding provided by the David and Lucille Packard Foundation. It has nine strategies for conservation action:  land use planning, environmental education, pollution, monitoring and research, best practices in farming, climate change, sustainable use of resources, capacity building for local authorities and government institutions, development of an alliance of stakeholders to  support and implement the strategies.      An alliance of NGOs has been very active for the past year fighting the construction of developments in and adjacent to the IBA. Actions have included  educating the public and local authorities about the environmental services provided by wetlands, legal challenges to proposed developments, public demonstrations, international letter writing campaigns, publicizing the development threats through local and international media and presentations at international meetings.    The Panama Audubon Society has developed an educational curriculum for the local schools to teach school children about the value of wetlands and help them develop a conservation ethic. A shorebird monitoring project has been started in conjunction with several other countries along the western flyway to provide information on the health of migrant populations. A committee of scientists from local universities and NGOs is being formed to oversee and propose research needs for the Bay of Panama wetlands and more recently, funds have been obtained to initiate hydrological studies on the westernmost part of this IBA.",114353,confirmed,2006,,"A4i, A4iii",35,proposed,2007,Vul,

Hunting is likely to be a problem near inhabited areas. In the eastern part of the area, small farmers have recently participated in a program that gave them formal title to their land. These formal titles have enabled them to get low interest loans to â€œimproveâ€ their land, which often means converting it to cattle pasture. In response, land prices have gone up, in some cases almost doubling. Illegal logging also takes place to obtain the highly sought-after cocobolo wood (Dalbergia retusa).","State of key populations:  Threatened species include Great Curassow Crax rubra (Vulnerable) and Great Green Macaw Ara ambiguus (Endangered), both of which are threatened by hunting, and the macaw also by capture for the pet trade. Six restricted-range species also occur. The macaw was occasionally seen at higher elevations several years ago but there have been no recent sightings. It is thought to persist in some lowland valleys but there is no information on population size. The curassow is reasonably common in a private reserve protected from hunting but heavily hunted elsewhere. Both the macaw and curassow are threatened by deforestation. The restricted-range species are all species of higher elevations, where deforestation has been less severe, and their populations probably have not declined greatly as of yet. However, there is a relatively small area of montane and cloud forest, so that climate change that reduces the area of these habitats could cause a future decline in these species.   State of key habitats:  The area includes lowland and montane evergreen forest, with cloud forest on ridges. Much of the lowland forest and some of the montane forest has been lost to deforestation for cattle ranching and agriculture.","A Panama Audubon member maintains 1000 ha at higher elevation as a private reserve. In the eastern part of the area, the Wounaan indigenous group has claimed and is protecting some patches of primary forest around the communities of Rio Hondo, Platanares, and Maje-ChimÃ¡n, totalling  approximately  25 km2, against the incursions of colonists from other parts of Panama.",114365,confirmed,2007,,"A1, A2",45,proposed,2007,Vul,

The establishment of such a reserve could attract numerous tourists (bird watchers) coming to Bukhara. Besides, this area can be use for the education of the students of pedagogical university of Bukhara for their field practical work and seasonal observations.

There were cases of reed burning, started by shepherds to increase food resources for cattle. The reed burning is very dangerous for many birds nesting in the reeds.A serious threat to waterfowl and diving ducks are gill nets abandoned by fishermen. They accumulate mainly in shallow waters and diving ducks can become entangled and drown.Poaching (fishing is prohibited in April during spawning) is common here. In April 2011 all reed areas were literally surrounded by fishing nets. Poachers are mainly local people from the village Ayakagytma. They poach because of the absence of other sources of income. Another problem is the cutting of saxaul and shrubs by local people. This leads to the degradation of the desert plant associations and as a consequence the loss of biodiversity.Almost all of the available area is used for livestock grazing. In some places areas are overgrazed.","In the area there is only one village, Ayakagytma, which is home to only 50 families. There is one school attended by 50 children. Local residents are engaged in cattle-farming and fisheries. Solitary shepherdâ€™s houses are evenly scattered throughout the Ayakagytma depression. Local residents are provided with electricity continuously but for heating and cooking they mainly use wood from saxaul and tamarisk.

Abandoned nets at the bottom of the lake and in the littoral zone constitute additional threats. However, the threat level is moderate because most of the birds during migration are distributed along the shoreline in shallow water areas where the nets are rarely located.The main threat is the change in water level of Sarykamysh. Rising water levels in the last decade has resulted in the loss of waterfowl nesting habitat. Currently, however, there is another serious problem connected to the construction in Turkmenistan of the Altyn Asyr reservoir and, beginning in 2009, abstraction from the collector that feeds Lake Sarykamysh.

The three most important threats were a random hunting, drainage of some ponds for seasonal crop farming practices and fish harvest along with seasonal burining of reeds which happen in fall and winter, as well as leasure fishing activities as a disturbance factor during the breeding and migratory seasons (fall and spring).","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: The condition assessment of IBA is performed based on both the quality of the habitat but also on the regular (annual) monitoring of bird populations in the site. Both mid-winter (IWC) counts and other monitoring activities carried out in different seasons of the year are used to assess the state of the populations. The overall condition of bird populations, i.e. those species which were identified as â€˜triggerâ€™ (Marbled Teal, White-headed Duck, Ferruginous Duck, Pygmy Cormorant, Eurasian Spoonbill, Glossy Ibis, pochards, herons and egrets) are stable and in a good state during spring migration and summer (breeding season). Some fluctuations between years do occur but those are largely due to weather variations, which have become particularly tangible over the past years. Warm falls and winters which leave most of open water bodies free of ice began to attract a high concentrations of wintering waterbirds and keep some breeders late until fall than compared to the previous years. However, fall and winter are the two seasons that are exposed to some random hunting which officially opens in October and lasts through the end of February each year. Overall, the condition of bird poplations at Armash is stable. State of the habitats of the trigger species: Armash fishery which is a network of artificial ponds supports a number of globally and nationally threatened bird species and is an IBA of global importance. Being a private property, it is managed exclusively for the benefit of commercial fish production in the country. However, its overall quality of habitats (ponds, shores, reedbeds and canals) which support species identified as â€˜triggerâ€™ are interpreted to be in a good state during spring and throughout summer which covers most of the breeding period and spring migration. In late fall and in early winter some of the ponds are drained for harvesting fish stock, but this practice does not affect the overal bird populations status in the site. As long as this symbiotic relation of mutual habitat support between the local management aand bird conservation priorities continues, it will be conducive to the preservation of wild birds in the IBA. Since routine practices such as seasonal burning of reeds and drainge of ponds in the fishery take place in winter, they have little or no effect on the overall 90% of breeding trigger bird populations.","Although Armash Fishery is one of the most important ornithological hotspots not only in Armenia, but also in the Caucasus and holds several Globally Threatened Species of Birds, it is a private property and business and designating this site under protection is not be possible. The site is managed exclusively to provide for commercial fish production and despite its practices are so far conducive to successful reproduction and preservation of â€˜triggerâ€™ bird species, breeding habitats of Marbled Teal, White-headed Duck and other species of global and national significance need to be protected. This is the only site in Armenia where GTBs Marbled Teal and White-headed Duck breed. Even though Armash fishery is a private enterprise closed to public access, it maintains very friendly relationship with ASPB and is open to offer the area for monitoring activities (IWC counts, other seasonal surveys) and even conservation measures be it of species or habitats, however, the site overal lacks amore consistent and coordinated monitoring.",117025,confirmed,2008,,"A1, A4i, B1i, B2",0,-,,,

Such practice removes most valuable species of trees (Â«creamingÂ») in the region. This high demand in good quality timber is met by a Â«shadowÂ» market which sprang up after the energy crisis in Armenia and supports illegal wood business for export of unprocessed high conservation value wood. Logging is also performed for fuelwood extraction by local communities. However, the latter is minimal and is not as destructive as logging for commercial benefit which causes serious degradation of the quality of tree structure. This, in turn, results in serious changes in species diversity and population density of birds confined to forest. b) Habitat loss and degradation is also amplified by extensive grazing of livestock by nomadic shepherds in forest, specifically in the upper tree lines where Caucasian grouse descends in winter. Observations suggest that extensive grazing destroys areas of rhododendron thickets and eventually leads to erosion of hillsides. c) Mining and d) construction of small hydropower plants is an emerging threat and is likely to cause an ecological imbalance of the region in the near future (i.e. shifting and pollution of groundwater system, further loss of biodiversity). Other factors causing decline of the species are poaching, egg collection and nest destruction by children and direct disturbance to birds by shepherd dogs and cattle. In fall when grass is dry, accidental fires inflicted by shepherds are frequent and can destroy the grouse habitat.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Given a very slow growth rate and continued over-exploitation of high quality roundwood it is estimated that this caused a moderate reduction in density of â€˜triggerâ€™ species confined to forest such as Eurasian Sparrowhawk, Lesser Spotted Eagle, Semi-collared Flycatcher, Caucasian Chiffchaff. A research held in 2009 suggested that population of the 'trigger' species Caucasian Black Grouse has noticeably reduced compared to the past. However, this was not due to intensive logging activty as the latter takes place at lower tree levels and is not used in winter when the grouse descends to lower elevations. Some tree cutting is practiced in the upper tree line by pastoral nomadic shepherds while they stay in higher pastures where livestock is herded for summer grazing, but in small volumes. As shown by study, reduced number of grouse is largely caused by overgrazing. The area of rhododendron is being lost due to extensive grazing and uncontrolled collection of rhododendron leaves and offshoots by local residents who gather it for tea. As a result of extensive grazing, foothills are eroded. The siteâ€™s condition is scored as 2 = â€˜Moderateâ€™. State of the habitats of the trigger species: Because regular monitoring of birds is not performed in the site and accurate population data are not available, the condition status for Dsegh IBA is based on habitat(s) and knowledge rated as 'Moderate'. Dsegh IBA is a site where forest (mostly broadleaves) making up a major portion (70%) of represented habitats, and minor proportions of alpine grasslands and rocky outcrops with patchily dispersed orchards and crop fields. Since its designation as an IBA, over the past 10 years the quality of habitats in Dsegh has deteriorated by ca. 15%. This is reflected mostly in the quality of montane forest. It is hard to estimate if or by what % forest area has shrunk, rather it has decreased in quality due to intensive logging by informal operators and 'shadow' industry market. New assessments (2011-2012) show that illegal logging has severely degraded the high quality species structure with beech making up just under half of the stock, oak (30%) and hornbeam (14%) especially valued for furniture and other species (walnut, ash, hazelnut, pear) making the most of balance.","A Site Action Plan for Dsegh IBA has been developed by ASPB (within the frames of Development of IBA Caretaker Network in the Caucasus project. However, it is oudated and needs to be revised as many of the activities included in the old version have been implemented. New set of targets needs to be defined. ASPB appears to be one of the key and long-term stakeholders in the area. For the past 5 years ASPB has been working to conserve local biodiversity, promote environmental awareness among local communities, promote caretakerâ€™s work in the area with schoolchildren and working with local government officials. From 2010 ASPB has taken steps to promote alternative livelihood for local community by developing infrastructure for ecotourism development. ASPB has established a first of its kind Nature Visitor Center in Dsegh IBA which will aim to generate alternative income source from ecotourism and serve as unique crossroad for NGOs, scientists, tourists, tour agents. It will serve both as an education center for young generation and will provide valuable information to tourists on local wildlife, existing conservation challenges, will help in promoting tourism activities (e.g. birdwatching). The creation of the center may help local population become actively involved in service provision for tourists by working as guides, renting horses, selling local products and handcrafts, offering B&B accommodation and other. Altogether this will help to minimize pressure on natural resources, especially on forest. This initiative is supported by SVS/BirdLife Switzerland, the Rhone-Alpes Regional Council (France), and UNDP Small Grants Programme in Armenia. The Center will be enhanced with interactive environmental information products and additional nature trails leading to key nature and cultural destinations in the area. In 2013 with support from BirdLife Secretariat ASPB has applied to the Darwin Initiatives fund to ensure continued support of alternative livelihood opportunities in the IBA. This project uses a pro-poor tourism (PPT) strategy to unlock opportunities for the poor to benefit from tourism linked to natural resources conservation. Unlike the existing efforts, Darwin-funded initiative will also promote regional markets (especially cross-border with Georgia), will place a greater emphasis on local empowerment (training, supporting local business enterprise, development of the IBA-Caretaker network); more rigorous monitoring to improve understanding of how community tourism affects livelihoods and use of natural resources. Activities by other stakeholders: A community-based ecotourism initiative was completed by WWF Armenia within the framework of the ENPI Forest Law Enforcement and Governance Project (ENPI FLEG) funded by the European Commission (EC) (2009-2012). The aim was to protect and ensure sustainability of adjacent forests through alternative forest use â€“ including collection and processing of forest fruits and berries. WWF-Armenia is also involved in development of bed-and-breakfast accommodation (3 local families in Desgh community) and development of a small tourist resort area at Lake Tsover, renting out equipment (tents, sleeping bags etc.) and developing signed trails.

Threats are assigned identical numbers as shown in the table below: Two current treats causing disturbance to habitats and wildlife are: 4) Transportation and service corridors and 5) Agricultural intensification both used intensively by local residents (40 housholds) living on the territory of the reserve for their daily vehicle access and livestock ranching practiced on over 20 ha of rangeland. Fingers of grazing land 200-500 m wide and 1-5 km long penetrate into the reserve territory and herds are regularly driven through the reserve from adjacent farms; 3) Overexploitation, persecution: an outright poaching is practicsed inside the reserve by people backed up by the oligarchic parliament which remains unpunished due to political permissiveness of the government. Poaching is practiced for hunting wildlife trophies and entertainment. 2) Human intrusion and 1) the quasi-legal construction of recreational facilities, building roads which run through the heart of the reserve are the greates causes for concern because they are planned and implemented at high government level in defiance of all laws. The latter is the greatest threat Khosrov IBA is facing and if this trend is not clamped down, we may lose a valuable biodiversity hotspot.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: The condition assessment of Khosrov IBA is based on both the quality of the habitat but also on the current population size for two â€˜triggerâ€™ species (for which there is good information): Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus) and Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Regular (annual) monitoring of these species is carried out in Khosrov throughout the year and is used to support the condition assessment of the site. Data is also reported to the management of Khosrov State Reserve. Since designation of Khosrov Reserve as an IBA, the population size of Cinereous Vulture numbered a total of 6 breeding pairs. With subsequent years thanks to ASPBâ€™s conservation efforts (research, nest gurding, artificial feeding) to recover the species population in Armenia (Khosrov is the only breeding ground for Cinereous Vulture in Armenia) number of pairs grew and are now estimated at 10 pairs, while more pairs (12) are assumed to exist but these observations require further verification. Despite that the popultion size since the designation of IBA has grown, the optimum for the site still remaines unattained because historically documented data for 1960s-1970s reported the optimum population size of Cinereous Vulture in Khosrov to be 21-22 pairs. So the percentage of the population remaining is 54% which is interpreted as poor using the â€˜weakest linkâ€™ approach. The situation with the endangered Egyptian Vulture in Khosrov is somewhat different as there was a slight decline in the number of species in Khosrov since its designation as IBA. Currently the population size numbers 3-4 pairs while the historical optimum in undistirbed conditions was estimated at 5-6 pairs, leaving over 60% of the population remaining. Overal, the condition for both â€œtriggerâ€species is considered as poor. State of the habitats of the trigger species: Khosrov IBA is an area that covers the territory of Khosrov State Reserve and spans four landscape zones: desert/semi-desert, mountain steppe, woodland, and alpine and subalpine meadows, although much of high-altitude habitat (meadow steppe on plateaus and rocky areas) lies outside the reserve. Landscape diversity ranges from semi-deserts to alpine meadows covering elevations of 900 - 2500 m. True forest and open woodlands occupy 16% of the reserve, open grasslands - 20% and rock-dwelling xerophylous communities - 64%. Even though Khosrov State Reserve has the highest degree of environmental protection in Armenia according to national categories, some villages are still situated on the territory of the reserve and a fraction of rural communities continue to live in the neighborhood. In 1985 a number of agricultural lands were taken away from these residents for further inclusion into the Reserve and they were compensated land plots elsewhere, but 40 households still continue to use 20 ha of rangeland inside the reserve. Even though the majority of households use the reserve territory only in summer (as summer residence) and only one third resides in winter, the impact of the human pressure on the landscapes is relatively strong. There is a certain overlap between the boundaries of the Reserve and those of land-use which allows some sort of violation of the protection regime (car access and livestock herding, etc). This fact jeopardizes the overall integrity of the protected area. However, Khosrov Reserve is currently facing a new danger that is greater than the ones above. In 2006 the Armenian oligarchic government began to implement its â€œshadowâ€ plan of direct acquisition of Armenia's natural lands. This is done through passing quasi-legitimate legal acts and activities which go in defiance of all existing regulations and laws (Law on Protected Areas of Armenia) such as tourism development inside the state reserves (which is prohibited in Â«zapovedniksÂ»), building facilities in the heart of protected areas, withdrawing large swaths of lands from reserves and renting it to members of Parliament, and even downgrading the status of Protected Areas to Â«legitimizeÂ» the processes in the eyes of the public. Khosrov Reserve has become the prime target of powerful oligarchic rulers since 2008 when a building for Restaurant and Recreational Center was constructed in Gilan district of Khosrov State Reserve. The two-storied building quasi-legally constructed on the territory of the reserve belongs to Speaker of the National Assembly. In 2010 under strong public pressure of local environmentalists the construction was stopped, but the building is not dismantled yet which leaves this issue unresolved. A recently published website of Khosrov reserve shows that the area of the Reserve totalling 29.158 ha is reduced leaving an area of 23.000 ha. Some 6.000 ha of land has been removed from the Reserve and given away without legal justifications. Hunting wildlife trophies is another ongoing threat backed up by the government. A recent visit of environmentalists to the Reserve discovered carcasses of slaughtered wild animals (national red lists such as Bezoar Goat, Caucasian Bear), home-made hunting traps, traces of bonfires and leftovers of barbecue parties. In order to further the ownership and disintegration of Khosrov territory, the government solicits financial investments by WWF, UNDP and recently also Caucasus Nature Fund (CNF) to develop Â«sustainableÂ» tourism in Â«zapovedniksÂ», and the Ministry of Nature Protection drafted a new Law on PAs to â€œlegitimizeâ€ these activities without discussion with the public and under the name of â€œsustainable tourism developmentâ€ to begin a wide scale infrastructure development (building new highways inside the reserve, etc) that would serve the interests of an oligarchic group. Currently a strong environmental movement is trying to oppose these processes in relation to Khosrov and demands resignation of the Ministry cabinet. Despite all the onging threats habitats supporting the trigger species have not been severely affected so far and over the past 10 years the quality of habitats in Khosrov has gone little modification. As of today, the site is interpreted to be in a failry moderate (2) state throughout the year.","Over the past 10 years a number of actions were implemented by various donors in Khosrov. These include a study of national red lists and globally threatened species such as Bezoar Goat and Caucasian Leopard which were initiated and supported by WWF Armenia; the Whitley Laing Foundation for International Nature Conservation/Rufford Small Grant program was implemented in 2002 to assess the status and distribution of adverse human activities in Khosrov Reserve and predict their actual or potential impact on the biodiversity. The seven large mammalian species were used as representatives of biodiversity which, due to their large body size and sometimes solitary life, demand for vast areas, often clash with people and respond very sensitively to human effects: Caucasian Leopard (Panthera pardus), Brown bear (Ursus arctos), Gray wolf (Canis lupus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), Bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus), Moufflon (Ovis ammon) and Wild boar (Sus scrofa). Other international donors (Caucasus Nature Fund/CNF, Norwegian Government, UNDPâ€™s Small Grants Programme in Armenia) supported actions to strengthen institutional capacity of the reserve and promote ecotourism development on the territory. In 2007 WWF Armenia completed a construction of a Visitor Center in Khosrov and surveyed trails to assess their match for tourism and identified sites of main sightseeing destinations. Since 2002 ASPB has been a long-term conservation partner in Khosrov and has been involved in regular research and monitoring of all threats, pressures, assessing the condition of the area and recording trends in bird population changes, specifically those species identified as â€˜triggerâ€™. ASPBâ€™s conservation efforts involved direct actions such as nest-guarding of vultures, monitoring of their fledgling dispersal, artificial feeding of vultures and satellite telemetry of both Cinereous and Griffon Vultures. These actions are intended to be continued in future as part of our activity.",117028,confirmed,2008,,"A1, A3, B2",0,-,,,

Direct threats to birds are illegal fishing activity as well as disturbance from fishermen and motor boats, eespcially at the site sof bird congregation during migration and breeding season; cattle grazing and watering in restrictred sites (former breeding areas of White-headed Duck), during breeding and migration; illegal shooting and uncontrolled hunting of birds, drowning in nets. Factors leading to habitat degradation are: a) destruction of foraging habitat, b) logging in adjacent forested areas, c) mining works on the territory of IBA, d) recreational pressure (non-regulated creation of beach resorts and summer holiday campsites), e) residential expansion (ownership) and infrastructure development along the shores, f) overfising.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Even though regular (annual) monitoring of species is carried out at Lake Sevan throughout the year to collect current data on birds, the condition assessment of IBA is difficult and is not definitive. Despite that during the past several decades Lake Sevan had lost its value as nesting ground for waterbirds and served mostly as a stopover point for migratory bird populations, starting from 2005 in view of increase in the lake's water levels small flocks of Glossy Ibis, Black-crowned Night-herons, Eurasian Spoonbill, Squacco and Little Egrets have been re-discovered nesting again at Lake Sevan IBA where their breeding has not been reported for 30 years! In 2008 ASPB recorded 20 nests of Glossy Ibis, 13 nests of Black-crowned Night-herons, 7 nests of Squacco Egret and 6 nests of Little Egret which re-established themselves as colonies again. In 2012 breeding waterbird fauna was replenished by another missing species â€“ Great Cormorant that was common until 1950s but bred only at Lake Sevan. In 1950s because of the drainage of Lake Gilli (SE corner of the lake) the nests of Great Cormorant disappeared. The cormorant continued to use the Lake only as a stopover point during migration and winter ground. This year, almost 50 years later a large group of Great Cormorants resumed its breeding at Lake Sevan and occupied a newly formed strip of land near the Gull Islands. So from the time of deisgignation of Lake Sevan as IBA, bird populations overall show signficant increase in both the species diversity and numbers recorded. This is proved by the regular counts held in various seasons of the year and the resumed nesting of many bird species which have not bred at the Lake for decades because of continued habitat degradation. The istuation is improving now with the rise of the water level, however this positive change refers to only 25% of the area of IBA which makes it difficult to provide an estimate for the entire IBA. State of the habitats of the trigger species: For Lake Sevan IBA, condition assessment is based on both the quality of the habitat which is rigorously monitored each year for habitat changes and existing threats and the population sizes for 'trigger' species for which data is collected by ASPB and local IBA Caretaker. Bird populations are monitored regularly during breeding, migration and wintering periods, the latter is accomplished through the annual mid-winter (IWC) counts from land and from boat (!) which include Lake Sevan as a count site. Lake Sevan is known for one of world's largest colonies of Armenian Gull (Larus armenicus) making up a significant proportion of the entire species population of the Asia Minor and for offering refuge to globally threatened species such as Lesser White-fronted Goose (Anser eythropus), Ferruginous Duck (Aythya nyroca). The lake and its surrounding wetlands serves as a stopover point for many migratory ducks and other waterfowl which stop to rest from their lengthy journey during spring and fall migration. In winter large herds of swans, cormorants, herons and egrets, and a high diversity of wader species choose the lake as their wintering habitat. Between 1980s and early 2000 Lake Sevan and its surrounding wetlands had lost its value as nesting ground for waterfowl but continued to serve as a stopover point for many migratory waterbirds and shorebirds. The ecological condition of the site had undergone tangible changes due to lowering of level in the lake. Since 2000 the water level soared by 3 m and under the governmentâ€™s long-term rehabilitation program, Sevan is to rise by another 3.5 m by 2029, an effect of which was the appearance of shallow wetlands and the restoration of suitable roosting and foraging grounds for wetland-dependent species. According to ASPB's estimate based on our (good) ecological knowledge of the site this positive change in waterbird habitats restoration relates to some 20% of the IBA. After years of shrinking Lake Sevan's growth is a positive on and ASPB's regular monitoring of the site suggests that the increase in the lake's water evel has a beneficial impact on waterbird fauna, as some bird species begin to re-establish their nesting grounds. However, despite these positive changes in the habitat quality of a small area (<40%), commercial fishing and illegal hunting are still observed and are poorly managed by the Park. Over the last 7 years the trout reserves in Lake Sevan have been reduced by 100 times. Its natural reproduction is also threatened by the constructions of hydroplants on rivers and the resulting changes in riverbeds. Livestock grazing is not controlled by the Park, even in areas of strict reservations and continue to cause disturbance to birds, especially in spring and fall during their stopover at the lake. Another threat which is a real attack on Lake Sevan is a mining industry which is expanding its area on the territory of IBA. One moning company has a running project to produce magnesium-silicate and chromite mine in Shorzha village located along the Lake Sevan northwest, while another company introduced a project on developing marl limestone, the main ingredient for cement production. Shorzha mine contains chromites and is located 2-3 km from the Lake and the dust from crushed chromites are regularly blown off into the lake. Despite the decision of a scientific committee on Lake Sevan to close down the project (as per Article 10 of Armenia â€˜Law on Lake Sevan', its decision was reconsidered by the Ministry of Nature Protection and both companies continue to operate today not far from the shore in violation of the norms and regulations of the Law. Lake Sevan is a very large IBA and it is difficult to provide a condition assessment of this site because the situation is extremely variable. On the on hand the ongoing increase in the lakeâ€™s water levels and the emerging shallow wetlands along its southwestern and southeastern shores began to attract the waterbird fauna which had disappeared decades ago and now brings back many waders outside of the periods of migration and winter. On the other hand the overal habitat condition of the IBA and its qality is very poor, as only <40% of territory can be considered as living a positive change which can be readily confirmed in the nearest future. Lake Sevan IBA is still affected by threats from illegal hunting, fishing, uncontrolled grazing of cattle even in areas of strict reservations, human disturbance from newly created holiday resorts and beaches along the shore, residential expansion and mining activities.","ASPB is one of the key stakeholders in the area who in tandem with the Institutes of Hydro-ecology, Ichthyology and Zoology holds regular survey of Lake Sevan. The hydro-ecologists take and study samples of phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos and phytobenthos, as well as measure the transparency and other parameters of the water. The researchers also took the samples of water for further study of hydroecological status of the lake based on hydrochemical and hydrophysical parameters. Bird populations are monitored by ASPB parallel to the lake studies from boat and from land throughout the year. Also in 2008 as part of the project Â«Development of IBA caretaker network in the CaucasusÂ» lake Sevan caretakers have implemented two small grants to address soe of the direct threats to bird populations. These grants involved actions to minimize threats to the globally threatened bird species (White-headed Duck and Lesser White Fronted Goose) in sites of their possible stopover and extensive public awarenss actions with local communities targeting fishermen, members of local hunting clubs and the rangers of the Lake Sevan National Park. Back in 2008 disturbance from fishermen to 90% of wintering and breeding birds at sites were removed. Small grants were implemented in specific sites at Lake Sevan. As most of the wintering and breeding waterbirds used to concentrate in the southern part, where disturbance by local fishermen was highest and caused wintering birds to spend extra energy and jeopardizing their survival or forcing them to move to smaller wetlands open to hunting. The caretakers met several times with the fishermen and the National park to agree on a reduced number of landing sites to reduce disturbance. These were properly sign-posted. In early November 2007 ca. 30 motor boats were documented to access the lake from 10 different points along the entire segment of the shoreline (from village Tsovak to Geghamasar), by 2008 total number of motor boat stations reduced to 5. It was later reported by caretakers that the number of the parking stations in the southeastern segment of the lake (from villages Tsovak to Geghamasar) had reduced even further, so the number of boats accessing the lake was coordinated. The official installation of signs was fully attended by the Park administration, while the entire event was videotaped and broadcast on the local TV channel (at local level). Also, based on the regularly updated data a Site Action Plan was developed by ASPB but needs to be revised. Apart from research, some conservation actions such annual Eurobirdwatch takes place at Lake Arpi with participation of local IBA caretaker as well as the staff of the Lake Sevan National Park.",3617,confirmed,2000,,"A1, A4i, B1i",0,-,,,

This is then followed by future persistent plans of the government to buid a number of hydro power plants on the river Dzoraget which runs through the IBA and will have significant impact in the short term. Since 2010 a gold mine company (Armanis) started its open pit stripping works adjacent to the river and dumps its waste into the river Dzoraget. Initial survey results already suggestthaht water in the river is contaminated, has turned brown and fishermen complain there is no fish in the river. This level of pollution is likely to affect migratory bird population that choose this place as a stopover point.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: For Tashir IBA, population data is not available because regular comprehensive monitoring is not accomplished and scores for the condition status of the site are based on its habitats. Even though for Tashir habitat conditions may not be relevant as it s a site important for migratory birds, data on potential threats can be used to assess the condition. Additionally, if at the time of site designation Common Crane (Grus grus) was listed as a trigger species for Tashir with 4-5 breeding pairs between 1995 â€“ 2000, in the past 10 year period the colony of these birds has been lost and stopped nesting, but this was due to human disturbance and hunting, rather than changes in habitat quality. State of the habitats of the trigger species: Because regular monitoring of bird populations in the site is not performed consistently and accurate population data are not available, the condition status for Tashir IBA is based on general ecological knowledge and condition of habitat(s) only. Tashir IBA lies in the Lori Plateau at elevations of 1400 â€“ 1800 m, bounded by the Javakheti Mountain Chain from the west. The area where the two types of habitats meet - the mountain steppe and alpine meadows - accommodates a chain of small to medium-sized natural lakes, scattered wetlands, wet meadows and planted orchards, isolated pineries, broadleaved and mixed forests and highland pastures. Despite that Tashir IBA is one of the key nesting grounds for Red-necked Grebe in Armenia, it has little importance as breeding ground for birds in general. However, its wetland habitats serve as wintering grounds for a large diversity of waterbird species (including White Egret, Black-crowned Night-heron, Common Teal, Garganey and Red-crested Pochard, Tufted Duck, Smew, Lesser White-fronted Goose which is endangered both in Armenia and the Caucasus). And above all, Tashir is one of the important flyway sites in the country for almost all groups of birds. This place reaches its peak time in spring and fall, when large flocks of migrating waterbirds and raptors stop here to refuel. These include Common and Long-legged Buzzards, Pallid and Western Marsh Harriers, rarely Red-footed Falcon, abundant flocks of Common Pochard, occasionally White-fronted Goose and very uncommonly Red-breasted Goose as well as passerines such as Lesser Grey Shrike, European Goldfinch, Brambling, Chaffinch and more. Overall, the site boasts some 240 bird species that occur both during breeding, wintering and migration. Based on our observations (although not regular) of the last 10 years and on our ecological knowledge of local threats and habitats, about 85% of habitat condition in Tashir is good and is scored as 2 = â€˜Moderateâ€™.","ASPB has a local caretaker based in Tashir IBA who performs regular monitoring of habitats and birds and organizes Eurobirdwatch events with local students. The local caretaker is vested with very good skills to observe and monitor the bird populations in all the wetlands in Tashir IBA however modest financial support is needed to ensure the consistency and sustainability of these actions. With reference to general ecological threats as well as specific threats mentioned above (e.g. gold mining), Coordinator of a local Aarhus Center which is based in Stepanavan town is intensively involved in activities protesting these developments and has created a working group to deal with the daily supervision of the issue.",105906,confirmed,2002,,"A1, B1iv, B2",0,-,,,

Most of the area is covered by forests, which are home to all of the ten criteria species. All of them were monitored in 2005â€“2007 and the attention was aimed at main core areas of their occurrence. Populations of the Black Stork and Ural Owl are in good condition (there is an obvious increase in numbers of the Ural Owl). Conversely, numbers fell in case of the Whitebacked Woodpecker and Redbreasted Flycatcher (old forests are harvested, there is a marked fragmentation in several places and thus the most important habitat for these species diminishes). The situation is unfavourable also in case of the Western Capercaillie, whose numbers decrease in the long run. Populations of the Hazel Grouse, Eurasian Pygmy-owl and Grey-faced, Black and Three-toed Woodpeckers cannot be evaluated as hitherto monitoring results and knowledge about their areas have not been sufficient. Harvesting old forests is a serious problem in parts of the SPA, because future occurrence of the criteria species depends on that habitat. For maintaining favourable condition of populations of the White-backed Woodpecker, Red-breasted Flycatcher and other species it is necessary to support soft forestry methods (i.e. damaged and dead trees should be left in the forest, as well as saplings, which should not be planted artificially but rather should grow in a natural way). These would result in stabilizing suitable nesting habitat. In localities where the Black Stork, Hazel Grouse, Western Capercallie and Ural Owl occur, disturbance must be stopped at the time of breeding; it is also necessary to consistently assess all plans for new footpaths, bicycle routes and skiing tracks. Still unprotected remnants of virgin forests should be proposed and designated as nature reserves.  Horni Vsacko SPA consists of sections of two Carpathian mountain ranges separated by the Vsetinska Becva river valley, where there are extensively managed submontane meadows neighbouring with mountain forests. The forest criteria species are the Black Stork, Hazel Grouse, White-backed and Threetoed Woodpeckers and Redbreasted Flycatcher. Two other criteria species â€“ the Corncrake and Red-backed Shrike â€“ are birds of open country. Monitoring of criteria species in 2005â€“2007 showed that populations of Black Stork, Corncrake and Red-backed Shrike are stable, the current status of the Hazel Grouse and Three-toed Woodpecker could not be evaluated. The numbers of the White-backed Woodpecker and Red-breasted Flycatcher were decreased, due to the logging of oldgrowth forests and habitat fragmentation. The numbers of these species can only be maintained if symphatetic forestry practices are adopted; these mainly involve leaving of standing and fallen dead wood and ensuring diverse age structure of forests. All disturbances, such as forestry works, building new footpaths and trails for cyclists, should be prevented at Stork and Grouse nesting sites. Threats to some Corncrake localities are earlier mowing, intensive pasture and demand for changes in land-use. The situation of the Red-backed Shrike is currently optimal, but in the future it will be necessary to take management measures to keep the habitat in optimal state.",,,100622,confirmed,2002,,"A1, B2, B3, C1, C6",0,-,,,

More than 90% of the SPA lies within the Military Training Area. A detailed ornithological monitoring of all the avifauna begun in 2004; and together with a targeted monitoring of the criteria and other more numerous Birds Directive Annex I species, which was organized in from 2005 to 2007, it confirmed the prime importance of this area. More than 20 Annex I species nest here, of which the Hazel Grouse, Corncrake, Eurasian Pygmy Owl, Three-toed Woodpecker and Wood Lark are criteria species (the Boreal Owl and Barred Warbler are now proposed as qualifying species). The main problems which this SPA faces are the insufficient legal protection of the criteria species, exploitation of the mature forests, a reduction of military activities and the planned removal of a considerable section from the military area to build a downhill skiing complex with accompanying infrastructure. This complex is planned in a part of the SPA which holds all the criteria species.

The Peregrine returned to its historical nesting area on its own in 1998 â€“ after 30 years of absence and it has been a regular breeder here since 2000. Falcon numbers gradually rose to 3â€“4 pairs and now seem to be stable. The Eurasian Eagle- owl numbers (8â€“10 pairs in 2005â€“2007), on the other hand, have decreased by 30â€“40% since the end of the 20th century. Disturbance by tourists leaving permitted trails and illegal rock climbing at the time of courtship and nesting is a threat to both criteria species. Both species are at risk in the surrounding countryside because of power lines (collisions with wires and electrocutions). Several measures were taken to help both species in 2005 and 2007: admission to areas with Peregrine Falcon nests was strictly forbidden, the nests were guarded and security features were installed at high voltage power lines; the guards at the nests also controlled rock climbers. A media information campaign about both criteria species was initiated and the SPA has its own website.

The main problÃ©m this SPA faces is the degradation of wetlands, resulting from the disturbed hydrological regime, silting and eutrophication. The fragmentation of older floodplain forests continues. On the other hand, the current management of the pinewoods is advantageous for both the Eurasian Nightjar and the Wood Lark. The Wood Lark population has increased considerably since the beginning of the 21st century, even if this can partly be explained by the fact that we know more about the population of this species now. At the moment, the biggest threat to this SPA is the plan to build a modern motorway, which would cut through an area with high densities of both Eurasian Nightjars and Wood Larks. Only one route for this road was considered and no alternative solutions were taken into account during the decision- making process.",,,100686,confirmed,2002,,C6,0,-,,,

This is reflected by the choice of criteria species: there are three wetland species (the Western Marshharrier, Common Crane and White-spotted Bluethroat) and two species of open pinewoods and heathland (the Eurasian Nightjar and Wood Lark). The situation of three of these five criteria species is favourable: the Crane numbers have been growing slowly but steadily since the first case of nesting in the 1980s (to 12 pairs in 2007). At least 20 pairs of Wood Larks and almost 20 pairs of Bluethroats live here. On the other hand, the numbers of Western Marsh-harriers have slightly decreased (from 13â€“14 to 10â€“11 pairs) since 2000â€“2004. The Eurasian Nightjar population has been more or less stable, so far at 20â€“25 pairs, but the two key localities at the former military training area areseriously threatened by rapid successive growth of bushes and trees and if these growths are not cut back immediately, it is inevitable that the nightjars will gradually abandon these places.",,,100652,confirmed,2002,,C6,0,-,,,

Even though the fishpond is used for fish farming and for recreation there is also a calm zone for birds, which is set aside as a Temporary Protected Area from 15th July until 30th November. The restriction on hunting is another positive factor. The fishpond is drained and harvested every second autumn and in the following year its water level is usually lower. As the water level is the decisive factor for breeding of Common Terns, it is necessary to prevent its fluctuations. The terns nest on an artificial islet (built in 1991 and repaired in 2004, when a second islet for the species was also built).

There are large open areas on the sites of former villages and former farmland. Other important habitats include large tracts of broad-leaved (mainly beech) forests and the rocky valleys of the Ohre River and its tributaries. About 30 Annex I species occur here, of which 11 are criteria species. The Red Kite is now recommended as a new criterion species. Monitoring has confirmed favourable conservation status of nine criteria species (the Black Stork, European Honeybuzzard, Corncrake, Eurasian Eagle- owl, Grey-faced Woodpecker, Black Woodpecker, Barred Warbler, Red-breasted Flycatcher and Redbacked Shrike), while only the Western Marsh-harrier and Eurasian Nightjar numbers have decreased since 2002. The main problem for this SPA seems to be rather rapid successive growth of thorny bushes on the plains, due to the reduction in military activities and farming. The forest-living criteria species mainly suffer from the harvesting of old beech forests and disturbance caused by forestry activities at the time of nesting. The nature protection bodies have set conditions permitting harvesting and other forestry work only with their agreement.

Both species found optimal wintering conditions here at the turn of the 21st century: uncut grass on wet meadows and unharvested agricultural crops offered excellent habitats with night time roosts and hiding places during the daytime. However, the farming practises at some sites have changed in recent years and the extent of suitable habitats has been much reduced. The SPA was monitored in the winters from 2005/2006 to 2007/2008 and no more than 10 Northern Harriers and three Short-eared Owls were recorded. The lower numbers of wintering birds in the last few years can be partly explained by the lack of both night and day hiding places, because more of the grass and crops were cut and food is also less accessible for the birds, because of the changed patterns of cultivation. The current extent of suitable habitats with daytime and night time cover for the criteria birds is not optimal and the future of both species at this SPA depends to a certain extent on the introduction of suitable management of permanent grasslands. A threatening factor for both criteria species may be the planned construction of a motorway along the western boundary of the SPA.",,,100663,confirmed,2002,,C6,0,-,,,

The Berounka river flows through the region in its deeplyincised valley. The SPA is of special importance for broad-leaved forest birds, four of which are criteria species: the Grey-headed Woodpecker, Middle Spotted Woodpecker, Red-breasted Flycatcher and Collared Flycatcher. The other four are the European Honey-buzzard, Eurasian Eagleowl, Eurasian Pygmy-owl and Common Kingfisher. Monitoring has confirmed that the populations of all of the criteria species are in favourable conservation status. This is true even for the Common Kingfisher, the population of which was found to be at a minimum in 2007. The Eurasian Pygmy-owl population rose from less than 10 pairs 30 years ago to 40â€“70 pairs in 2007. Similarly notable increases were recorded for the Middle Spotted Woodpecker and Collared Flycatcher populations. The main threatening factors for the criteria species are the felling of broadleaved forests and growing disturbance by forestry activities, tourists, mushroom pickers, mass sport and cultural events and other (for example by illegal riding of quad-bikes). Permitted periods for felling trees and other forestry work and a minimal distance from nests for these activities have been established in the cases of the European Honey-buzzard and Eurasian Eagle-owl: such work can only be started after an approval is granted by the nature conservation authority. Approval is also needed for felling of forests which are older than 80 years and contain at least 50% of broad-leaved trees in specific time periods.",,,100633,confirmed,2002,,"B2, B3, C6",0,-,,,

The Birds Directive Annex I criterion species is the Black-crowned Night-heron. The Greylag Goose, Northern Shoveler and Redcrested Pochard are species covered by Article 4.2 of the Birds Directive. The Black-crowned Night-heron population is stable in the long term. An average of 240 pairs have been nesting at the Zamecka Fishpond colony in the past 15 years and a new colony was established at the Mlynsky Fishpond in 2006. The highest numbers of Greylag Geese and Northern Shovelers which have been recorded here in the last 10 years meet the tresholds for establishing an SPA. The Red-crested Pochards have exceeded the threshold of 250 birds every year except for 2007, which was caused by the fact that the Pochards moved to a moulting site outside the SPA. The new Management Plan for the Lednicke rybniky National Nature Reserve includes the aestivation of fishponds, which began in 2005 (two fishponds have been kept on low water over the summer so far). In spite of the forbidden hunt in the SPA, the hunters sometimes do not obey the conditions of protection and enter the littoral vegetation.

It was established for eight criteria species, of which four nest in forests (European Honey-buzzard, White-tailed Eagle, Middle Spotted Woodpecker and Collared Flycatcher). The Barred Warbler and Redbacked Shrike inhabit areas with shrubs and scattered trees, while the Syrian Woodpecker lives in orchards and gardens in villages. Individual pairs of White Storks nest in villages, although there was also a colony of White Storks in the floodplain forest at the Krive jezero National Nature Reserve until 2005. With the exception of the White Stork and White-tailed Eagle the populations of the other six criteria species are considered to be stable. The reasons for disappearance of the White Stork forest colony at the Krive jezero are not known. One pair of White-tailed Eagle nests here every year, but the SPA is also a wintering site for this species. A total of 6â€“12 birds spent the winter of 2005/2006 here, whereas in the following winter eagles were not recorded here at all, as they probably moved to neighbouring areas. The breeding habitats of the criteria species are not currently in danger. However, the nesting sites of the Syrian Woodpecker could be endangered in the future if old village orchards are liquidated.",,,40,confirmed,2002,,"A1, B2, B3, C1, C6",0,-,,,

The most important birds are the raptors â€“ the European Honeybuzzard, Black Kite, Red Kite and Saker Falcon (the White-tailed Eagle and Imperial Eagle are also recommended as qualifying species). Birds of broad-leaved forests (the Grey-faced Woodpecker, Middle Spotted Woodpecker and Collared Flycatcher) are also other criteria species. The woodland breeding colonies of White Storks (also rather â€žlooseâ€œ colonies on solitary oaks) are another typical feature. The Common Kingfisher is the last criterion species. The situation of the White Storks is not favourable and their numbers decreased by about a third between 2000â€“2004 and 2005â€“2007, the reasons for which are unknown. The conditions worsened for the broadleaved forest species (the Middle Spotted Woodpecker, Collared Flycatcher and partly also the Grey-faced Woodpecker), because of the significant reductions in the area of old floodplain forests. The populations of raptors and the Common Kingfisher are in favourable state. The biggest threat for this SPA are the plans to fell large tracts of old woodland, so that a substantial part of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker, Grey-faced Woodpecker and Collared Flycatcher habitat would disappear within a short period and the raptors would also partly be at risk. Therefore, negotiations to cancel, or at least postpone, the harvesting of several hundred hectares of old forest stands are under way. Protection measures will be implemented for the benefit of some insect species in other parts of the forest, which may also benefit some of the birds. The establishment of a protected landscape area is also suggested for this area. Another threat for this SPA may come from the controversial intention to connect the Danube, Odra and Elbe rivers by building navigation canals with the construction of parts of this project crossing the SPA.",,,41,confirmed,2002,,"B2, B3, C6",0,-,,,

Moreover, it is an important summer congregation site for the Greylag Goose (up to more than 7,000 birds in 1980s, max. 2,500 individuals after 2000) and a wintering site of the Whitetailed Eagle (up to 60 birds). The numbers of congregated/wintering birds fluctuate depending on the weather conditions each winter, but the concentrations of geese (Greylag, White-fronted and Bean) also depend on the inten- sity of the hunting pressure â€“ i. e. level of disturbance. Numbers of Common Tern have fallen significantly in the last six years (95 pairs in average, while the average for the previous six years was 234 pairs). This is caused by unsuitable conditions for breeding: traditional nest islets have been flooded after the water level was raised and terns have been forced to move to unsuitable sites, where their breeding success is very low. The principal measure to be taken to renew the breeding population is the permanent lowering of the water level and keeping the islets in a condition suitable for breeding terns (this mainly requires preventing the islets from being overgrown by dense vegetation).",,,43,confirmed,2002,,"A1, A4i, A4iii, B1i, B2, C1, C3, C4, C6",0,-,,,

Other important habitat types are peatbogs, extensive tracts of wet and peaty meadows and forest-free enclaves on the former military training areas. More than 20 Birds Directive Annex I species nest here, of which nine are criteria species (and additional two â€“ the Peregrine Falcon and Ural Owl are now proposed for protection). The populations of the Black Stork, Corncrake, Hazel Grouse, Eurasian Pygmy-Owl, Boreal Owl and Black Woodpecker are stabilized and in favourable status. The Western Capercaillie and Threetoed Woodpecker numbers have increased slightly. The only species for which the situation is unfavourable is the Black Grouse, the numbers of which are experiencing a long-term and gradual decline. The Sumava SPA has many problems, especially the consequences of massive wind calamities (and subsequently also bark-beetle calamities) in the forests, including the montane spruce forests. Problems also stem from the growing disturbance by the increasing numbers of tourists: the density of footpaths and cycling and crosscountry skiing routes is increasing, new border crossings are opened and new development projects have been completed and more are planned, all of which not only puts more pressure on the area, but may also destroy the habitats of the local criteria species. For the species living in open landscape (mainly for the Black Grouse), the main negative factor is the vegetational succession at sites left to natural processes. The Corncrake is being pushed out of some of its former core areas by grazing. Management plans to support these two species are under preparation for selected localities.

About one half of the SPA is covered by forests. The extraordinary diversity of this area is also reflected in the high number of criteria species: 16 Birds Directive Annex I species plus 3 waterbird species, which congregate in the area. The populations of 11 Annex I species are stable or even increasing. Some of these birds only colonized this region as recently as the 1970s or 1980s (the White-tailed Eagle, Eurasian Pygmy-owl, Boreal Owl, Whitespotted Bluethroat). Forestry activities are not a serious negative factor. On the contrary, the Cooperation between conservationists and foresters is excellent in the case of protection of Whitetailed Eagle nests. The biggest decrease in numbers (to approximately 40% of the situation at the turn of the century) was recorded with the Western Marsh-harrier, the reasons being the disappearance of littoral vegetation and putting mud dredged from the fishpond bottoms on the banks, the fluctuating water levels (so that nests are either flooded or become accessible for predators), illegal hunting and destruction of nests, which is still being recorded. The Common Tern numbers fluctuate considerably and their breeding sites are at risk because of unstable water levels and predation by wild boars. There was a slight decrease in the Black Stork numbers, probably because of the large numbers of tourists in the forests and disturbance during works to remove the consequences of hurricanes. The new clearings, which were formed by the wind storms will probably be advantageous for the Eurasian Nightjar, the population of which fell, probably as a result of changes in forestry management (the clearings are smaller now). The Wood Larks main habitats are the former sand- and gravelpits. After extraction is stopped, these localities are left to become overgrown with forest and the larks gradually disappear. Of the three species which occur during congregation, the situation is not favourable in the case of the Greylag Goose. The main reason for this is the fact that the start of the hunting season has been brought forward from September 1st to August 16th. Duck-shooting is still not allowed at that time, which results in stronger hunting pressure and greater disturbance to geese at congregation sites and on pastures in late August, as well as during their flights between them. Therefore, most of the geese leave the area when the hunting season begins. It is therefore advisable to reunify the hunting seasons for both ducks and geese from September 1st. General disturbance is increasing with the growing usage of the area for tourism and recreation.",,,36,confirmed,2002,,"A1, A4i, B1i, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, C6",0,-,,,

The industrial port activities induced also pollutions of water and sediments.   Other major threat is hunting activities (without any information on the scale and magnitude of the harvest it is difficult to determine how hunting affects the IBA).

Due to the streambed erosion of the Rhine (from 1940 to about 5 meters), the groundwater level decreases in the entire river flood plain of the Rhine, and the area, in particular the wetland habitats, is drying out. 2. The agricultural use is being further intensified. The previously dominant grassland-based dairy farming is converted currently into a stall-feeding no-grazing shed system. The grassland is managed in a close succession of mowing and liquid manure supply, being more of a sort of arable land use, where no bird species are able to breed. The nitrogen emissions from factory farms affect and endanger the habitats. 3. Increasing recreational use such as camping, water sports, fishing and hunting, leads to more and more disturbances of bird species and the loss of nesting and resting areas. Of particular note are the various forms of air traffic (hot air balloons, small planes, ultra-light aircraft and gliders, gyrocopters, helicopters) and drones. 4. Construction of infrastructure, building areas and in particular gravel excavations, to which more than 5,000 hectares have been exposed since the designation of the special protection area.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: The breeding birds of wet and moist meadows and pastures, the so-called meadow birds, have experienced a dramatic decline in recent decades in the special protection area. Ruff and whinchat are extinct, other species such as common snipe, corncrake or spotted crake are about to become extinct or remain only at certain small areas or in certain favorable years. The population decline is also evident for formerly typical species such as black-tailed godwit and lapwing, which have suffered population declines of over 90 percent. Even the populations of formerly very common meadow songbirds as skylark and meadow pipit have declined in a dramatic way and they are no longer found everywhere on the grasslands along the German Lower Rhine. The characteristic species of the aquatic and marsh areas have been doing a bit better. The populations of the black tern and the common tern have increased significantly because of specific protection measures. Species of reed beds such as bittern, little bittern and great reed warbler are extinct. The wintering populations of bean geese and white-fronted geese are largely stable during the last decade with the usual fluctuations. Contrary to the national trend, the wintering populations stocks of both the whooper swan and the Bewick's swan at the German Lower Rhine have decreased massively. The Bewick's swan has become an accidental visitor. The stop-over population of the golden plover at the German Lower Rhine has declined from thousands of individuals, which rested regularly for weeks, to irregularly occurring small groups and individual birds. The stop-over population of the lapwing, which had been long the most common species, has declined by over 90%.. State of the habitats of the trigger species: This special protection area is a large agricultural river landscape with numerous man-made water bodies, some oxbows and a few secondary alluvial forests. The main land use is dairy farming. The agriculturally used area - except for the land owned by nature conservation organizations â€“ is farmed very intensively, which has led to a steep decrease of the valuable species.The agricultural intensification with reinforced drainage and enhanced fertilizer use has an ever increasing negative impact on the grassland of the area. The increased fertilizer application and the early drying out of the soil after winter allow earlier mowing times and an increase of the frequency of grass cutting. The chicks of meadow birds are directly threatened by the cultivation of the land. The grassland is also getting very poor in plants and flowers by the enhanced intensification. Another problem which arose mostly during the last few years, is the diminishing pasture use and almost exclusive mowing of grassland and, not least, the conversion of semi-improved grassland to arable land or re-seeding with agricultural grasses.The conversion of grassland to arable land is the most harmful agricultural intensification. As a result of drainage, conversion of pasture to meadows, fertilization, frequent cutting and many accompanying measures such as weed control, plowing, re-seeding with agricultural grasses, the conversion followed by the use as arable land means the permanent loss of grassland. The reasons for that are the conversion of dairy farming to arable and factory farming, as well as the increasing demand for corn and other agricultural products for the operation of biogas plants.All habitats are threatened by the high nitrogen surpluses. The water bodies in the special protection area are exposed to an intensive recreational use, whereby the natural vegetation is affected..","Despite a number of conservation projects and comparatively intensive area supervision by the biological stations, the negative trend cannot yet be stopped. Improvements could be achieved so far only in certain areas (for example the stabilization of the meadow bird populations in the sub-region 'Hetter - Millinger Bruch' as a result of a LIFE project). The overall negative development cannot yet be reversed. Measures aimed at prevention against the drying out of the entire area, against the intensification of agricultural use and the return to nature conservation friendly farming practices are of particular importance.",125125,proposed,2003,"A1, A4i, B1i, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, C6",C7,0,-,,,

Illegal hunters operate during the absence of wardens, forming â€˜ringsâ€™ and placing decoys, or using speedboats at open sea. Disturbance is affecting Pelecanus crispus colonies resulting in breeding failure few years now as well as other trigger species. The Management Body has proposed to open areas to hunting within Zone A of protected area. Another major threat for Pelecanus crispus and many other species is disturbance to their colonies caused by fishermen, especially during activities targeted at the limitation of illegal fishing and at scaring cormorants away (using searchlights, gas cannons, speedboat patrols, nets etc.). Other illegal interventions are common, such as filling in of wetlands and operation of illegal landfills, operation of illegal industrial livestock farming units, road construction, illegal logging of riparian forests and sand extraction. Other threats recorded in the area are the use of poison baits, the installation of an antenna and the fatal collisions of Pelecanus crispus on power cables installed by the Public Power Corporation.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: The wetland complex of Amvrakikos gulf holds the largest number of waterbirds in Greece (>100,000 wintering birds, more than 25% of the national populations).

Furthermore, it hosts one of the three remaining breeding populations of Pelecanus crispus in Greece (80-100 pairs).Also breeding of Aythya nyroca (40-80 pairs). State of the habitats of the trigger species: The wetland complex of Amvrakikos gulf is one of the most important wetlands in southern Europe hosting a large variety of habitats formed by the deltas of rivers Louros and Arachthos which flow into the north part of the gulf: lagoons, sand bars, salt marshes, reedbeds, wet meadows, mudflats, riverine zones with remnants of riparian forest etc. The site includes the most extensive reedbeds and salt marshes, as well as the largest complex of lagoons in the country. The lagoons are characterized by high biological productivity and function as natural fish farms both for fish and crustaceans, providing food for many bird species. Extensive drainage works, dams, river diversions, thousands of drillings and other serious interventions have altered the hydrological balance and caused serious problems in the gulf: the reduction of fluvial sediment and the erosion of sand bars, gradual salinisation of coastal areas and the degradation and shrinkage of reedbeds.

The most important issue relating to the water level is the existence of thousands of drillings around Koroneia, resulting in the lowering of the groundwater table and the reduction of the lake’s volume. Many mass death incidents of fish and/or birds have been recorded since 1995 (e.g. in 1995, in 2004 – when more than 230 Pelecanus crispus died among other species – and in 2007). On two occasions, the lake totally dried up (2002 and 2008). A programme of debatable effectiveness and environmental logic is now being implemented with European funding for the restoration of the lake, with no indications of any improvement of the situation until today. Lake Volvi is in a much better conservation status, but still faces problems mainly related to illegal logging at the forest of Apollonia and the riparian vegetation, water abstraction directly from the lake and the streams, as well as illegal hunting. There are concerns that the pollution from Koroneia will flow into Volvi after the construction of a connecting trench included in the restoration plan for lake Koroneia.","State of the trigger species: This site is important for migrating and wintering waterbirds. More than 20,000 waterbirds overwinter here regularly. The wintering populations of several waterbird species have declined (including Podiceps cristatus, Aythya ferina and Fulica atra) while the surface-feeding duck populations have increased. Other species with significant populations in the area are: Anser albifrons (W), Cygnus cygnus (W), Anas strepera (W), Aythya fuligula (W), Ciconia nigra (non-B) and Aquila pomarina (non-B).

Other important threats include road construction which results in disturbance of breeding raptors, as well as illegal logging of mature trees used for nesting. Finally, an important threat – which is expected to become more acute in the future – is the gradual abandonment of extensive livestock breeding practices.

The predation of the Whooper Swan nests (other threat) is rather rare case.","State of trigger species: One trigger bird species of the IBA â€“ Little Tern â€“ is gone from the area because of habitats change.

State of key habitats: Key habitats of the area mostly are in bad condition. Almost half of the ponds' area are without water and overgrowing with reed and woody vegetation. This is why the area of the suitable habitats for waterbirds has became almost twice smaller. Those ponds, which are still filled with water are used for the recreational fishery, thus are under high disturbance impact and only partly used for the waterbird breeding.

The area still suffers from other threats such as off-roading, illegal dumping and to a certain extent also illegal hunting and trapping (though since the LIFE project of 2006 these threats have been on the decrease as a result of increased surveillance and awareness). The maritime area off the sea cliffs is en route to other islands of touristic value, and especially during the summer months disturbance may be caused by passing maritime traffic especially night boat parties, for which legislation controlling this practice was enacted in 2010. A reef located within less than 2km of the colony is currently being speculated for an offshore wind farm development project, for which currently an EIA is being prepared. In preparation of these EIA studies, a wind monitoring mast has been erected in close proximity to the Yelkouan Shearwater colony and has been in place since 2009, presenting a collision threat to shearwaters.

There is a significant number of recorded events of accidental capture of this species through fishing in this IBA (Vingada pers. com.). However, the outcomes of the coastal inspections carried out between 1980 and 1990 did not record increased mortality in this species (Granadeiro et al.  1997). Therefore, an accurate assessment of the potential factors for mortality and of possible mitigation measures is recommended.  This area partly overlaps with the pilot area for trials on wave energy. Therefore, the possible impact of this type of device on the distribution and abundance of seabirds and their potential prey should also be carefully monitored. Other possible impacts arising from human activities, such as sea transportation, pollution, or the potential existence of offshore windfarms should also be assessed.   At the same time, the impact from fishing activities, giving rise to reduced food for birds or accidental capture is not adequately quantified in this IBA, and a better assessment is urgent.  ","This IBA, exclusive marine, is defined by the presence of a globally threatened bird, the Balearic Shearwater. In the IBA, the water depth increases from 10 to 70 m at the end of the IBA, 25 km from the coast. The boundaries of the IBA stretch from 4 km north of Praia de Mira and 4 km south of Praia da Vieira, being this coast characterized by an extensive chain of dunes and some limestone cliffs in the Figueira da Foz area. The mouth of the Mondego river, at the centre of the IBA, is recognized as being of ornithological importance (IBA PT039), as is the Ria de Aveiro ZPE, also designated as an IBA (PT007), north of the proposed area. In terms of fishing, the Figueira da Foz harbour is one the most important in the country for off-loading pelagic species such as the sardine, since dragnet fishing and longline fishing are residual in this area.   An estimation of 1.100 to 3.000 (ind) Balearic Shearwater uses this IBA waters, especially during migration and winter.  ","Boat-based surveys are carried out regularly by SPEA under specific projects/programs (project FAME from Atlantic Area Program & project LIFE MarPro), to monitor and record seabirds occurrence. Also monitoring aboard fishing vessels is being conducted, since 2011, to assess fisheries interactions and bycatch events with seabirds. SPEA (under FAME) also develop a report on recommendations for the management of the IBA, and this will be discussed with local stakeholders during 2013.",127097,confirmed,2008,,"A1, A4ii, B1ii, C2",0,-,,,

Currently there is no legal protection given to the site. Recently, a major touristic development was announced for this area, occupying all the IBA land and with an expected capacity of over four thousand beds. SPEAâ€™s permanent activity, together with local NGOs such Almargem and local activists, linked to the current financial crises, has so far prevented this.   Besides, the lagoon suffers from eutrophication caused by the unregulated discharges coming from two water treatment plants located north of this IBA, together with regular polluted runoffs coming from the surrounding agricultural fields and golf courses. The lagoon has severe problems in maintain the levels of water stable. Some examples below translate in conditions of too much water (flooded areas and opening to the sea) or small levels of water (illegal drainage from the lagoon and consequently mortality of birds by lack of food, during the breeding season). The implementation of the recreational structure in the flooded area reduces significantly the lagoon capability for retain water, and, consequently, increasing flood frequency and in the opening the lagoon to the sea. One of the major problems is the illegal subtraction of water from the lagoon, during the summer, to irrigate the golf field. This IBA is located in a very busy touristic area; especially in summer where thousands of Portuguese and European visitors visit the nearby beaches and pass by the area using the existing cycle lanes. SPEA has repeatedly tried to promote a sustainable use of this area, together with local and regional institutions and birdwatching routes and hides are in place. The development plans are still in place, together with the inexistence of an appropriate water management plan that would stop the seasonal flooding of the surrounding area in winter time (because of increased water table levels due to rainfall or water discharges from water treatment plants). ","The Portuguese IBA â€œLagoa dos Salgadosâ€ is one of the last remaining wetlands with palustrine characteristics in the Algarve, (Southernmost region of continental Portugal). The area comprises a major water body of approx. XX hectares, located just in between two small seasonal springs and a wetland on its Norwest limits. To the South, this IBA extends right up to the coastline, where a fixed sand dune acts as a natural barrier protecting the lake from strong marine winds.   Just besides the eastern limit of the IBA, we find the Salgados golf course, part of the XXXX hotel complex. All other IBA land is mainly occupied by cereal and fruit trees, with reeds predominantly occupying the limits of the lake.   The IBA is the only remaining wetland in the East Algarve, home to more than 150 species, amongst which we must mention Porphyrio porphyrio and Hymantopus himantopus. Several species are known to use this area for: nesting - Ardea purpurea, Ixobrychus minutus and Egretta garzetta; migrating â€“ Nycticorax nycticorax and Ardeola ralloides and wintering â€“ Ardea cinerea and Bubulcus ibis. It is the only recorded breeding site in Portugal for Aythya nyroca.  During migration, this IBA is very important for Ciconiiformes, specialy for Platalea leucorodia, waterbirds and passerines.

The presence of 4x4 vehicles in particularly sensitive areas (like the inside of saltpans tanks) and people at the main nesting sites, especially during the reproductive period, can be especially negative for some species.  ","The IBA area includes two saltpans complexes â€“ Alverca Saltpans and Forte da Casa Saltpans -, and agriculture fields of extensive exploration, in between. Situated in the North margin of Tagus estuary, is the only birdlife refuge across the river margin. In the surrounding areas there are very contrasting areas, like the heavily urbanized and industrialized area of Alverca, and on the other hand the Natural Reserve of the Tagus Estuary and the Portuguese Air Force installations.  Inside the IBA, besides the saltpans tanks and agriculture fields, there are also a vast group of drainage ditches and a small river (very rich in riparian vegetation) giving an exceptional importance to the whole system. Currently the salptpans are abandoned, so the levels of water in the saltpans are highly variable, mostly according to rainfall regime.   The Alverca and Forte da Casa Saltpans are one of the most important nesting places for waterbirds, in Tagus estuary, highlighting Himantopus himantopus with several hundreds of couples. This area is the only nesting place of Netta rufina, in the estuary. Highlighting also the nesting of Circus aeruginosus, Recurvirostra avosetta, Glareola pratincola and Sterna albifrons.   The species Ixobrychus minutus, Anas strepera and Fulica atra nests in significant numbers at the estuary. The whole area is very important to feeding for Ardea purpurea and Circus aeruginosus that nest within the limits of the Natural Reserve of the Tagus Estuary, being the estuary the country's most important site for nesting and the presence of these species. The area is also important for large numbers of migratory birds in wintering and migration, particularly for shorebirds and passerines that occur in large numbers and diversity during the spring, autumn and winter.  ","Several local and national NGOs (SPEA included) are preparing a joint complaint in order to stop any further construction threats, based on the IBA classification of the area, and on the regional and local instruments of spatial planning, which classified the area as green corridor and urban ecological structure.  Also, media actions are being developed, to alert the local governments and general public to the importance of the area for the conservation of bird species.

With the exception of 1615 ha of forest reserves (3.6% of total surface of forest) the majority of forest at IBA SneÅ¾nik-Pivka is intensively managed. Consequences of insect outbreaks and natural calamities are instantly removed. Logging concentrates on parts with large-diameter trees. Increasingly more low-quality wood, including dead and dying trees, is taken from the forest (used as renewable source of energy for wooden briquettes). As a result, dead wood is becoming scarcer (on average, dead wood represents only 3.4% of all wood at SneÅ¾nik-Pivka).","In Slovenia, forestry plans are accepted and approved as Natura 2000 management plans without proper environmental impact assessment. The main aim of those plans is economical and has little to do with nature conservation.

These are, if built, the largest in Europe and may cover the entire surface of SÃ¶dra MidsjÃ¶banken. It has not been possible to obtain information when the authorization decision in these matters will be taken. SOF has in previous contexts submitted comments on the proposed wind farm in the Swedish territorial water, in which we delivered a negative opinion on the entire project.   Based on research (http://seaducks.hgo.se/?q=system/files/dokument/Reserach%20on%20Sea%20Ducks.pdf) wintering sea ducks in the Baltic Sea are exposed to several pressures which possibly have contributed to long-term population declines. SÃ¶dra MidsjÃ¶banken, is e.g. of constant risk of oil spill which now and then kills large number of of sea ducks. Bycatch is also an important mortality factor. Ecosystem changes, at least partly due to global warming, affecting food resources, are potentially the most important reason behind decline of sea duck populations at present.","Key birds: SÃ¶dra MidsjÃ¶banken is one of the most important wintering sites for Long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) in Eurasia, and as many as 200,000 individuals have been noted. During the inventory of Long-tailed ducks in the Swedish Baltic Sea in 2009 SÃ¶dra MidsjÃ¶banken was the most significant of all banks in the Baltic Sea (Nilsson, 2011, L. Nilsson pers. comm.). SÃ¶dra MidsjÃ¶banken area is also important for wintering Common Guillemots, Razorbills and Black Guillemots but data on these species are very incomplete. The population of Long-tailed ducks is high enough to meet the criteria for appointment of SPA (Specially Protected Area) under the EU Birds Directive. Surprisingly this site lacks such protection today. Key habitats: Offshore bank of high importance for owerwintering sea ducks.",,60019,confirmed,2000,,B1ii,0,-,,,

This contrasts markedly with the early 1970s when the aquatic vegetation recovered almost immediately after the severe drought of 1970/71 (when all of the wetlands on the Iranian side of the border were completely dry). The reasons for the present lack of vegetation are unclear. It has been argued that the length of the drought in the early 1980s is the principal cause (some parts of the Hamoun-i Hirmand remained dry for six years) and the digging up of tubers for fuel may also have contributed. Another possible cause is the massive stocking of the lakes in recent years with herbivorous fish. The voracious Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) was introduced about 1988 and now supports a major fishery. Introductions continue with some two million fish released into the Hamoun-i Hirmand in 1992. The lack of emergent vegetation is of considerable concern to local people who depend on the marsh for grazing cattle and water buffalo. Very few livestock are now present around the Hamoun-i Hirmand and Hamoun-i Sabari, most having been moved to the Hamoun-i Puzak marshes on the Afghan border.

Scott   Threats    Direct threats  a . Water pollution.Pollution of the water entering the Sabkhat is generally recognized as a major threat to the integrity of the ecosystem . Agricultural, Urban and industrial developments round the sabkhat have resulted in increased inflow of human effluent, fertilizers and pesticides, and chemical waste from factories (these include a sugarâ€”beet factory and a chlorine factory under constructions ). As the sabkhat is a closed depression, polluted particles will continue to accumulate until their inflow is controlled. Pollution has already made the salt from the central lake unsuitable for any use and salt collection by villages has been officially banned. However, the salt is still used. Local villagers have regularly reported finding dead fish and dead young flamingos in recent summers, possible causes  would include pollution, drying up of the lake or increased salinity.  b. Fluctuating water and salinity levels. There is at present no management plan to regulate water levels and salt content, which therefore depend on the quantity of rainfall runoff, sewage water and drainage from irrigation. Sudden changes in water level and salinity can have adverse affect on the reedbeds and ecological value of the sabkhat, as noted in the southeastern lake in March 2006 . There are now plans to divert irrigation water to the Khanasser valley rather than to the sabkhat, the ecological and economic effect of these proposals are unknown and need thorough investigation before any investment is made.  c. Mismanagement and degradation of shore vegetation. The reedbeds are crucially important as safe feeding, breeding and resting areas for a wide range of birds, notably herons and ducks. It is likely that both the local community and relevant authorities are unaware of the reedbeds' ecological importance. This makes the reedbeds vulnerable to random interventions such as garbage dumping or burning. It is vital to include the reedbeds in the protected areas and to police their protection adequately. The shorelines with salt-tolerant vegetation may be important for a number of bird species, but overgrazing and regular disturbance make them unsuitable for nesting birds and reduce their ecological value.  d. Uncontrolled hunting and fishing. Hunting and fishing were banned in 1991 when the sabkhat became a protected area and a national hunting ban declared in 2001 now runs until 2010. Its enforcement is the responsibility of  local police officers, but it is not implemented, shooting can be heard on almost every visit to accessible areas such as the northern shore. There may be less hunting in the breeding season when birds are fewer in number. It is also forbidden for four months by an Islamic restriction. The southeastern lake is more remote and has three guards employed by the Department of Agriculture. The protection they confer may be limited but their presence probably has a vulnerable ground-nesting species, was breeding around the southeastern lake in 2005 and 2006. There is some fishing by villagers in the north of the central lake and in the southeastern lake but at present disturbance seems to be limited, major increases in fishing activity could have conservation implications.  e. Introduction of invasive alien species. Alien species have caused massive loss of biodiversity worldwide (Lowe et al 2000). There is no evidence so far of such introductions in the sabkhat, but introduction of alien fish for economic purposes has occurred in other Syrian wetlands (Serra, per sobs). This practice can cause irreversible damage to the whole ecosystem and should be strongly discouraged.    Land Use, Vegetation And Habitats:  Areas round the sabkhat  The sabkhat is surrounded by distinct farming communities and systems which have a significant impact on its vegetation and habitats:  - Northern and western shores: relatively densely populated agricultural plains, intensively cultivated throughout the year, whose farmers rely heavily on irrigation . Villages are relatively prosperous. Income is mainly from agriculture.  - Southwestern shores (the villages of  Haqlah to  Umm Amud saghir): mixed income from salt extraction, agriculture and off-farm activities.  - Southern shores (the northern part of the Khanasser valley):relatively poor communities dependent on dry-land farming (rain-dependent cropping that does not make use of irrigation), sheep-rearing and off-farm activities.  - Eastern shores: settled Bedouin villages at low density that depend on raising sheep and salt extraction. This area  has little infrastructure and is the poorest area around the sabkhat.  Salt extraction is a traditional economic activity for the village round the sabkhat. Though it was officially banned in 1984. It continues to generate important income for some villages. The impact of salt collection on biodiversity appears to be negligible as it occurs in areas where the lake has completely dried up.    ","Al-Jabboul Lake is located approximately 40 kilometers south-east of Aleppo.  It is very large in size, embracing over 100 square kilometers of saline, brackish and fresh water. Although the lake is considered a permanent water body, water levels fluctuate seasonally and the highly saline areas are regulated artificially by sluices. Much of the freshwater entering the Lake today is derived from irrigation water pumped from the Euphrates.    The lake was designated as a * Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 1989 for providing an important staging, wintering and breeding area for large numbers of water birds and for supporting more than 1% of the world population of Greater Flamingo.ï€ª All the lake has been designated as a nature reserve by the Syrian Ministry of Irrigation. The southern part as an additional designation under the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture    Historically, the Lake has been an important source of mineral salt and extraction continues to this day on a reduced scale.    Administratively, the regulation and management of the Lake falls between three government ministries, agriculture, environment and irrigation, and the Governorate of Aleppo   ",,130496,proposed,2014,,,8183,confirmed,2010,,Irr 3

More specifically, there are strong urban development pressures in the â€˜Southlandsâ€™ situated adjacent to Boundary Bay, and Tsawwassen First Nation lands situated adjacent to Roberts Bank. A major expansion of Port Metro Vancouver on Roberts Bank and adjacent uplands has also been proposed that would provide 2.4 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit containers) of container capacity. Developments associated with transportation and infrastructures related to industrialization of the Fraser River delta (e.g. jetties, causeways, highways, bridges, rail yards, and airports etc.) are ongoing and considerable. Conversion of open fields within the Agricultural Land Reserve to berry crops and other intensive agri-uses, and the construction of large-scale/industrial greenhouses have also decreased waterfowl and shorebird habitat. Species particularly impacted by these changes include Snow Geese, Trumpeter Swans, dabbling ducks, and shorebirds such as Dunlin and Black-bellied Plovers. The farmland also provides essential habitat for birds of prey, including Barn Owl and Short-eared Owl. The rivers and estuaries within this IBA are impacted by runoff from urban, industrial, and agricultural activities. The risk of oil spills and release of ballast waters is growing and of concern. Species likely to be impacted include loons, grebes, cormorants, diving ducks and alcids, all of which are abundant within this IBA. There are numerous introduced species and their impacts to native wildlife are largely unstudied. Examples of introduced mollusks include the Batillaria snail, the manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum), and the purple varnish clam (Nuttallia obscurata); all three are common within intertidal areas. Zostera japonica (an exotic eelgrass) is reducing mudflat habitat, particularly on Roberts Bank. Spartina anglica (an introduced invasive cordgrass) is proving extremely difficult to eradicate and control; this species can alter intertidal mudflats into unproductive grasslands. Recreational activities abound throughout the IBA and some of these disturb migratory birds, such as hunting, loose-running dogs, kite-boarding in shallow intertidal waters, and power boating in sensitive marine nearshore habitats such as eelgrass meadows. The long term impacts of such disturbances are not known, but could be significant.The forage fishery has declined in recent years, and there has been a corresponding decrease in diving birds. Gillnetting in neighboring Washington State (an intermittent fishery here during late summer) has killed many alcids too. Light pollution is potentially disturbing birds here, particularly within the heavily industrialized areas (e.g. marine port and airport); hunting behaviors of local Peregrine Falcons have been affected (documented evidence).","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: For a summary of updated bird records see http://ibacanada.ca/site.jsp?siteID=BC017&lang=EN Boundary Bay, Roberts Bank, and Sturgeon Bank form one of the richest and most important ecosystems for migrant and wintering waterbirds in Canada. This IBA supports globally or regionally (continentally) significant populations of 12 species, including American Wigeon, Northern Pintail , Brant, Trumpeter Swan, Western Sandpiper, Black-bellied Plover, Dunlin, Western Grebe, Red-necked Grebe, Glaucous-winged Gull, Thayerâ€™s Gull, and (possibly) Mew Gull. In addition, the IBA supports nationally significant numbers of Barn Owl and Peregrine Falcon (considered at risk in Canada â€“ see below). The most numerous species that congregates here is the Western Sandpiper with one-day, peak historic counts of about 500,000 individuals (spring migration), although more recent estimates range from about 120,000 - 200,000 individuals. One-day, peak counts of Dunlin typically range from 26,000 - 85,000 birds, but have exceeded 100,000 (2004). Dunlins use this site in winter too. Black-bellied Plovers occur during winter and on migration, with one day counts of up to 6,000 birds. In total, fifty species of shorebirds have been observed using this IBA. A significant proportion of the Wrangel Island Snow Goose population uses the banks; over 30,000 Snow Geese regularly use this area. The numbers of Snow Geese using the banks changes significantly even within one winter because the birds move back and forth between the Skagit River Delta. Counts of 60,000 individuals for the entire Fraser-Skagit Delta population are not uncommon between late October and March; about 100,000 birds were counted in 2007. During the fall/early winter, one-day counts of greater than 100,000 dabbling and diving ducks are regularly made here including: American Wigeon - over 50,000 in 2001; Northern Pintail - up to 43,830 individuals in 2004; Mallard about 26,979 in 2001; and Green-winged Teal. Surf Scoters occur in large numbers during the winter and spring migration, and typically 1,500-8,000 individuals, but as high as 28,200 in 2001. Significant numbers of Trumpeter Swans also winter in this IBA (1,455 individuals in 2010). Brant winter in marine waters (4,080 individuals in 2010) and pass through on spring migration. Most are the ssp. Branta bernicla nigricans. In recent years, about 200 Western High Arctic or Grey-bellied Geese have been observed here in winter. During the late summer and early fall, the area is also very important for moulting grebes. Historically, between 2,000 and 3,000 Western Grebes were regularly present in Boundary Bay, and a separate study reported over 2,000 on the estuarine banks at a similar time of year. However, the species has declined in numbers and counts since 2004 typically range between 200 â€“ 1000 individuals. This decline has been noted throughout the Salish Sea (in British Columbia and Washington); however, the reasons for such declines are unclear and are under investigation. Red-necked Grebes are also present here during spring/fall migration and winter with 2,716 individuals observed here in 2002. Glaucous-winged Gulls are present in significant numbers during the winter, with a peak count of 55,803 individuals in 2006. Large numbers of this gull species feed at the Vancouver Landfill in Burns Bog and roost in surrounding fields. Thayerâ€™s Gull occurs in large numbers in the winter as well, with up to 623 individuals counted in 2001. Significant numbers of Mew Gull are also present in the fall with counts of up to 1,217 individuals in 2007, and up to 3,770 in the winter of 2005.This IBA also regularly supports three nationally considered â€˜at riskâ€™ species (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada; COSEWIC listed species may qualify for legal protection and recovery under Canadaâ€™s Species at Risk Act). Great Blue Heron (fannini subspecies; Special Concern, COSEWIC) has several colonies in the IBA, including a large one (300-400 nests) situated on a forested bluff adjacent to Roberts Bank. These herons are resident, feeding in the intertidal areas during the breeding season, as well as on farmland, particularly in winter. Colonies have been affected by recent increases in Bald Eagles; some colonies have been abandoned and relocated to other areas in the lower mainland. The number of Bald Eagles using the IBA in the winter has also increased significantly in recent years. Barn Owl (Threatened, COSEWIC) nests within the IBA; 72 nest sites and 27 roost sites were confirmed via a study conducted in 2009. Peregrine Falcon (Special Concern, COSEWIC) regularly occurs here during the winter. State of the habitats of the trigger species: The Boundary Bay - Roberts Bank - Sturgeon Bank (Fraser River Estuary) IBA (http://www.ibacanada.ca/site.jsp?siteID=BC017&lang=EN) is a large and diverse area in southwestern British Columbia, near the city of Vancouver. It includes Boundary Bay, a predominantly marine ecosystem (~ 9% of the IBA is open sea) and the estuarine waters of Sturgeon Bank (between the north and south arms of the Fraser River) and Roberts Bank (south of the southern arm of the Fraser River) which comprise another 10 -15% of the IBAs area. The sea and estuarine areas, as well as freshwater portions of the Nicomekl River, Serpentine River, and Little Campbell River (< 5% freshwater) together comprise about 20% - 25% of the IBAs area. These areas have been degraded by urban and industrial pollution. Intertidal mud, sand, and salt flats are important here and comprise about 20% of this IBAs area along with salt and brackish marshes which comprise about 10% of its area. Large portions of the mudflats are degraded by invasive species, particularly Spartina spp. and Japanese eelgrass. These salt marshes are influenced by artificial dikes too. Arable land is another important habitat type within this IBA, comprising about 25% of its total area. Large amounts of open farmlands are used by waterfowl and shorebirds, but are lost each year with conversion of lands to support berry crops or greenhouses, construction of transportation corridors, and urban and industrial developments. Burns Bog is a special area (~ 6% of the IBA) and the quality of its habitat is threatened by its isolation and changes in hydrology/water use. Small patches of temperate forest (< 5% of the IBAs area) include mature coastal Douglas fir that provides important nesting and roosting habitat for Great Blue Herons and raptors, including Bald Eagles. Some urban and industrial areas are included in the IBA (~ 10 â€“ 15%) because they provide important habitat for some species (e.g. the landfill is used by large numbers of Glaucous-winged Gull and Bald Eagle).","Effectively managing threats is difficult here, in part, because of the large numbers of local, provincial, and federal authorities involved coupled with this areas â€˜development valueâ€™ (pressures): since 1985, the Fraser River Estuary Management Program has provided a framework for protecting and improving the environmental quality around the Fraser River - in conjunction with ongoing economic development. There is no IBA specific conservation plan. A patchwork of conservation management areas provides a degree of protection against habitat loss and other threats for a portion of the IBA. The Alaksen National Wildlife Area (including Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary) (299 ha) was designated in 1972 and consists mainly of four former deltaic islands which were joined together by causeways and dykes constructed in the earlier part of the 20th century. Boundary Bay (11,000 ha) was designated as a provincial Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in 1995, South Arm Marshes WMA (937 ha) were designed in 1991, Sturgeon Bank WMA (5,152 ha) was designated in 1998, Serpentine WMA (71 ha) was designated in 2009, and Roberts Bank WMA (8,770 ha) was designated in 2012. While management plans exist for these WMAs, they need to be updated (apart from the Serpentine WMA management plan). Several regional and local parks include important mudflats and marsh habitats along the shore (e.g. Boundary Bay Regional Park and Dyke Trail, Mud Bay Park, and Blackie Spit). The Nature Trust of BC owns land both within and outside of the dykes (e.g. 72 St. foreshore area on Boundary Bay and areas within South Arm Marshes). Ducks Unlimited also owns parcels of farmland within the delta. Over 2,400 ha of Burns Bog were designated as an Ecological Conservancy Area in 2004 and 2012. Much of the farmland within the IBA falls within the BC Agricultural Land Reserve, which was established to preserve agricultural land for present and future generations and to encourage the establishment and maintenance of farms as a secure source of food. Numerous conservation organizations are actively working to improve habitats for birds and other wildlife within, and external to, abovementioned conservation areas. Natural history clubs affiliated with BC Nature are leading volunteer stewardship activities. The Friends of Semiahmoo Bay Society (FoSBS) conduct many stewardship projects including eelgrass mapping and transplants, intertidal marine surveys, nest box installations, monitoring and maintenance, forest fish spawning habitat surveys and gravel placements, beach and sub-tidal cleanups, invasive plant speciesâ€™ removals, and tree plantings. The group also coordinates numerous educational programs, including the Birds on the Bay Program, World Oceans Day celebration, the Beach Hero Marine Interpretive Program, and school programs. The Delta Naturalistsâ€™ Society, White Rock and Surrey Naturalists, Nature Vancouver, and Langley Naturalists all undertake regular educational and stewardship activities around the IBA and they also monitor birds. The Boundary Bay Conservation Committee undertakes local conservation and advocates on behalf of many naturalist and environmental groups. Burns Bog Conservation Society, Surrey Environmental Partners Society, and the Little Campbell Watershed Society undertake outreach, advocacy, and stewardship activities to conserve their respective areas. A Rocha Canada is another organization that works within the Little Campbell River Watershed. The Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust have coordinated stewardship programs that benefit farming and wildlife in Delta since 1993.",118181,confirmed,2008,,"A4i, A4iii",0,-,,,

Key marine habitat sites for migratory birds in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories). â€œLancaster Sound, western Baffin Bay, and Davis Strait have potential to become marine shipping routes and areas of hydrocarbon exploration and development (Imperial Oil Ltd. 1978; Petro-Canada Ltd. 1979; DIAND 1982). There is also increasing activity by cruise ships or outfitters in boats from Pond Inlet and elsewhere in the eastern Arc tic (Marshall Macklin Monaghan Ltd. 1982; Wakelyn 2001).

Key marine habitat sites for migratory birds in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories)   â€œSix major seabird colonies occur around this area, at Baillarge Bay, Prince Leopold Island, Cape Liddon, Hobhouse Inlet, Cape Hay, and Coburg Island. Smaller colonies are also found at Skruis Point, Cape Vera, Baillie-Hamilton Island, and Browne Island. Most birds inhabiting these colonies move through eastern Lancaster Sound during migration or use it as a feeding area (McLaren 1982). At a minimum, 70 000 pairs of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), 135 000 pairs of Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis), and 386 000 pairs of Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) use this area, representing 35%, 57%, and 27% of the Canadian populations of these species, respectively (Nettleship 1980). In addition, several million non-breeding birds may spend all or part of the summer in this area, and large numbers mi grate through to nesting and summering areas in the central Canadian High Arctic and northwest Greenland (McLaren 1982). Northern Fulmars arrive in late April and by mid-May are concentrated along the Lancaster Sound ice edge or are commonly distributed throughout the offshore area. After June, fulmars are concentrated at the remaining ice edges and in coastal areas, particularly near their colonies; most have left the area by mid-September or early October (McLaren and Renaud 1979). Black-legged Kittiwakes generally arrive in late May or early June and concentrate along ice edge habitats. From mid-June through mid-July, kittiwakes are common and wide spread throughout much of the area, but they have left the area by mid- to late October (McLaren and Renaud 1979; McLaren 1982). A major influx of Thick-billed Murres begins about mid-May and continues into June, with the highest number occurring during the third week of May. During June, murres are wide spread and common throughout much of eastern Lancaster Sound and western Baffin Bay. During spring and early summer, murre densities are significantly higher along fast ice edges than along ice-free coastlines. Murres leave the area as freeze-up progresses.  A few thousand Black Guillemots (Cepphus grille) winter in open water areas of northwest Baffin Bay (Renaud and Bradstreet 1980). A major movement into the area occurs during late May. During June, guillemots are widespread through the area, along coasts, ice edges, and offshore (McLaren 1982). Dovekies (Alle alle) migrate through offshore areas of eastern Lancaster Sound and western Baffin Bay to reach colonies in western Greenland (Renaud et al. 1982). From mid- to late May 1976, approximately 1.63 million Dovekies were present in eastern Lancaster Sound (Johnson et al. 1976), and in spring 1979, approximately 2.4 million birds were present (Renaud et al. 1982). Migrating birds are concentrated in offshore areas with moderate to heavy pan ice coverâ€.   State of the key habitats:  The Lancaster Sound Polynya is located between the northwestern end of Baffin Island and the south coast of Devon Island. The shape and extensiveness of the polynya varies from year to year and associated leads being influenced by the severity of the winter, water currents and winds. Landfast ice starts to develop in late September, with the sound becoming completely ice-covered by mid to late October. Leads and cracks begin to form between mid November and mid December, and remain until break-up. One of the most regularly occurring leads is one that develops along the south coast of Devon Island. Mean tides are approximately 1.5 m. Water currents are dominated by the Baffin Bay intrusive current, which usually moves south and west into eastern Lancaster Sound and then east along northern Bylot Island at velocities up to 1 m/s (Dickins et al. 1990; Canadian Wildlife Service Occassional Paper 109, 2004).   Eastern Lancaster Sound is also important for many marine mammals, especially narwhal (Monodon monoceros), harp seal (Phoca groenlandica), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) (Dickins et al. 1990), with bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) moving through this region during migration (Riewe 1992; Fisheries and Oceans Canada 1999). Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are numerous in the Lancaster Sound area and use the northern coast of Bylot Island for maternity denning and as a summer retreat (Schweinsburg et al. 1982).   Contact Bird Studies Canada for source information (also attached with submission).  ","The Lancaster Sound National Marine Conservation Area project is underway, painfully slowly; there is some concern this project may not be completed/go further (possibly related to military activities; cited as â€œotherâ€ threat above).

There are eight additional SDLs within the Kendall Island Bird Sanctuary and another three SDLs immediately adjacent to the Sanctuary. A number of other SDLs have been issued within the Delta.   In short, this area is under considerable pressure from hydrocarbon exploration and related developments, and is a key stop-over and breeding area for a considerable number of birds and diversity of species.

Original IBA information is available here http://www.ibacanada.ca/site.jsp?siteID=NT016&lang=EN, while more comprehensive and recent bird abundance/distribution information for this area is available from Environment Canada â€“ Canadian Wildlife Service (document attached here, titled J-EC-00136 Mack Delta_KIBS JRP; see Appendix 1).   The below information is from the attached Environment Canadaâ€™s Mackenzie Gas Project Environmental Assessment Review Written Submission (Nov. 2006).     â€œThe Mackenzie Delta is the most important â€œkey migratory bird terrestrial habitat siteâ€ in northern Canada and one of the most important breeding, moulting, and staging areas for waterfowl in North America. More than 1% of the national population of at least 20 different species are present in the Delta at one time or another. Waterfowl, other waterbirds (e.g. loons, gulls, and cranes), shorebirds, and songbirds are present in large numbers during the staging and breeding seasons. Waterfowl from this area winter from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts and use all four major waterfowl flyways.  The waterfowl resource is shared by numerous jurisdictions and resource users in Canada, the United States of America, and Mexicoâ€.   â€œSome of the waterfowl populations from the Western Arctic are declining (e.g., Black Brant), being harvested near the maximum sustainable level (Greater White-fronted Goose, Canada Goose), or exist only as relatively small continental populations (Tundra Swan, Black Brant). There are international conservation concerns about populations of Lesser Scaup, Northern Pintails, Long-tailed Ducks, and Surf and White-winged Scoters, all of which have declined markedly over the past two decades and use this areaâ€.   From Appendix 1 of the attached, numbers of Tundra Swan and Canada Goose appear to be increasing, while Black Brant, Snow Goose, and Greater White-fronted Goose appear to have declined (a 1970â€™s and 1990â€™s study comparison).   State of the key habitats:  The information provided in the summaries of state and pressures below are related to this IBA (http://www.ibacanada.ca/site.jsp?siteID=NT016&lang=EN) and surrounding delta areas.   The Mackenzie River delta is an immense area of low-lying waters and deltaic islands that is situated just east of the Yukon/Northwest Territories border along the coast. The area includes Shallow Bay, Olivier, Ellice, Pelly and Kendall islands (Kendall Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary), as well as part of Richards Island. Much of the area is covered by fluvial deposits of silt and sand. The islands are generally marshy and covered in sedges, grasses, and horsetail, but there are shrubs in higher areas. Levees have formed along the shores of islands as a result of spring flooding. The lowlands of Richards Island are dotted with numerous lakes and ponds and contain several pingos. More than 5,000 Beluga Whales calve in the Mackenzie River estuary, and the outer islands support a significant population of Barren-ground Grizzly Bears.   This area is under considerable pressure from hydrocarbon exploration and related developments; see below.",Part of this site is a federally designated Migratory Bird Sanctuary; developments/activities are permitted in the Sanctuary under certain conditions.

We hope to update these records shortly and a summary is found below. In total, nearly 300 species of birds have been recorded at Prince Edward Point with about 220 species being recorded during an average year. Most of these species are recorded during migration, although at least 74 species nest here. A total of 162 landbird species (excluding raptors) have been recorded at this site including 36 species of wood warbler, 20 species of sparrow, and 12 species of flycatcher. As many as 2,000 hawks per day have been regularly recorded in the skies over this IBA, including large numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks (between 100 â€“ 550 individuals were estimated on several occasions during a single day at the Prince Edward County Point Bird Observatory and Migration Monitoring Station between 1997 â€“ 2011) and Red-tailed Hawks (between 100 â€“ 2300 individuals were estimated by abovementioned Observatory staff on several occasions between 1997 â€“ 2011). In total, 17 species of raptors have been observed here, including Bald Eagle and Peregrine Falcon. Vagrants include Swainsonâ€™s Hawk and Ferruginous Hawk. Prince Edward Point National Wildlife Area is unequalled in North America for the numbers of Northern Saw-whet Owl migrating during fall (Levesque 1985). Between 1975-81, for example, 2700 Northern Saw-whet Owl were banded (Harris 2000). Daily estimated totals (DETs) from the Observatory indicate that between 50 -114 individuals are regularly using this area during migration (1997 â€“ 2011 records). Waterfowl and gulls are relatively abundant here too. The below (within this paragraph) are DETs (the highest abundance estimates for a particular day) retrieved from the Prince Edward County Point Bird Observatory from 1997 - 2011. Long-tailed duck in 2000 and 2003 were estimated at 150,000 and 225,000 individuals respectively, and in 2001 and 2002, 30,000 individuals (DET) were recorded here. The DET for Greater Scaup in 2001 and 2008 was 10,000 and 16,600 individuals respectively. The DET for Red-breasted Merganser in 2005 and for Red-necked Grebe in 2011 were both 6000 individuals (both unusually high counts). The DET for White-winged Scoter in 2007 and 2011 was 2000 and 4000 individuals respectively. Bonaparteâ€™s Gull had DETs of 5000 individuals in 2005, 2009, and 2011. Double-crested Cormorant DETs in 2004 and 2008 were 18,000 and 30,000 individuals respectively. Brant DETs in 2007 and 2009 were 4760 and 1510 individuals respectively. Refer also to the IBA Canada database â€“ see above link. Species at Risk: Henslowâ€™s Sparrow (IUCN NT; COSEWIC EN in ON) - Four singing males were heard in May 1999 and two in May 2000 at Ostrander Point which increases optimism this species may again breed in this IBA (Harris 2000). No information from the CMMN at Prince Edward Point (1997-2011). Rusty Blackbird (IUCN VU; COSEWIC EN ON and elsewhere in Canada) â€“ 150 were recently recorded in eBird (2010) and from the CMMN DETs, this species is relatively prevalent with 800, 180, 175, and 170 individuals recorded in 2011, 2010, 2004, and 2007 respectively (if we calculated numbers in passage, the numbers could be impressive). Several other DETs with >100 individuals exist. Cerulean Warbler (IUCN VU/decreasing) â€“ CMMN records indicate 10 were here in 2004, but otherwise, just one bird has been recorded in 2003 and 2010. Hooded Warbler (COSEWIC TH in ON) â€“ observed annually during migration, but in low numbers. CMMN records show 1 or 2 individuals per day or season depending on the year. Yellow-breasted Chat (COSEWIC SC in ON) â€“ observed annually during migration. CMMN records show 1 bird in passage every couple/few years. Peregrine Falcon (COSEWIC SC in ON and elsewhere in Canada) â€“ observed annually, but only about one or two during passage and perhaps a few annually (CMMN). King Rail (COSEWIC EN in ON) â€“ A rare and irregular visitor in the region (Ron Weir, pers. comm). In June 2000, a call was heard in the Simpson Road Marsh, Point Petre Provincial Wildlife Management Area (Harris 2000). Black Tern (provincially/ON listed as VU) â€“ This species has been observed at three locations in the IBA during the breeding season. On June 5 and June 24, 2000, 32 and 16 terns respectively were observed (Harris 2000). CMMN records indicate 15 individuals in 2002, but within the past decade, very few were recorded (0-3 per year). Breeding has not been confirmed, but is suspected with a small colony within the wetlands of Ostrander Point Crown Land Block. Other IUCN listed species use this site irregularly in and small numbers including: Chimney Swift, Golden-winged Warbler, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and Red-headed Woodpecker. In short, a diversity of birds utilize this IBA, some in relatively high numbers. State of the habitats of the trigger species: Prince Edward County South Shore IBA (http://www.ibacanada.ca/site.jsp?siteID=ON003&lang=EN) is an irregularly shaped peninsula at the north end of Lake Ontario, in Prince Edward County. The IBA is 279.31 kmÂ² with about 30% comprised of lands and 70% freshwaters (Lake Ontario). This IBA encompasses about 30 km of shoreline, the only lengthy, undeveloped strip of shoreline remaining in Prince Edward County and one of the few shorelines of Lake Ontario that has remained undeveloped (Ross 1999). Shoals and areas of deeper water are located off the tip of the peninsula. The Point is comprised of shallow soil over limestone bedrock. Much of the habitat consists of old field (savannah) and shrub thickets, with small tracts of deciduous and coniferous forests. In addition to being important for migrating birds, the site also supports several rare vascular plants including Ontario aster, downy wood mint, and clammyweed among others. The below proportions are approximations: Freshwater â€“ Lake Ontario: 70% Freshwater (marshes and small pools on the peninsula) 7% Temperate forests (deciduous, coniferous, mixed; open and dense areas) 11% Agriculture (crop and pasturelands) 11% Grasses, sedges, herbs 1% It was estimated that about 45% of the land area within the IBA is under public ownership. The Prince Edward Point National Wildlife Area is contained by the IBA (north tip of the peninsula) and provides protection (IUCN 1A) for just under 2% of a northern area of the land peninsula. Another designated protected area (IUCN 1A) provides protection of a small island that crosses outside the IBA boundary to the northeast; this protected area covers <1% of the IBAs area. Spatial data for the above two designations are available via the Canadian Council on Ecological Areas (CARTS database). The remaining public lands include: Point Petre Provincial Wildlife Management Area, Point Petre Antenna Site, Ostrander Point Crown Land Block, and the Little Bluff Conservation Area. There are about 60 privately owned properties inside the IBA; about half of these properties are assigned a land use designation â€œvacant landâ€ (Ross 1999).","The Ontario Government currently permits renewable energy projects on certain crown owned lands. This led to a proposal and approval to site 9 turbines within the Ostrander Point Crown Land Block which is situated inside this IBA. This unique threat was not considered while drafting the IBA Conservation Plan and Nature Canada (and other ENGOs), local naturalists and citizens are upset at not having been adequately consulted prior to approval. An appeal (via the Environmental Review Tribunal of ON) was launched by a consortium comprised of the abovementioned groups/people which has thus far halted construction.",118490,confirmed,2008,,"A4i, A4iii",0,-,,,

Manitoba Habitat Heritage Co. owns 2 small parcels of land totaling about 1.3 km2 and 4 small parcels of land totaling 6.6 km2 are provincially owned and designated as Wildlife Management Areas. However, these WMAs (Pierson, Broomhill, and Gerald W. Malaher) offer no protection and accordingly, the MB government does not submit these protected areas into Canadaâ€™s database of protected areas (via Canadian Council on Ecological Areas/CARTS database). This IBA is under immediate threat from rapid development (e.g. agriculture, oil/gas, and potentially potash and gravel extraction). This region and the prairie grassland regions of Canada and central North America more generally speaking, have been extensively modified with significant loss of native grasslands and natural areas in the past century. In some regions, there has been irreversible destruction of suitable habitat for grassland bird species, resulting in the extirpation of Burrowing Owl, Spragueâ€™s Pipit, Chestnut-collared Longspur, Bairdâ€™s Sparrow, Loggerhead Shrike, and others from large areas of southern Manitoba (Birds of Manitoba 2003). Where a number of IBAs could have existed in the past, numbers of grassland birds (many now listed as at risk by the IUCN and COSEWIC; Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) continue to decline; inevitably some of these A1/C1 sites will be lost too (numbers of regularly occurring birds will not meet thresholds) unless measures are taken to provide stronger, more consistent protection from developments (e.g. oil/gas) and continued agricultural expansion and systems modifications.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Researchers (Manitobaâ€™s Conservation Species At Risk Biologist and ornithologists/biologists from the University of Manitoba, Bird Studies Canada, and Nature MB) are aware that several hundred pairs (~750 individuals) of Sprague Pipit breed here (IUCN VU/decreasing global population), although annual numbers do vary somewhat with precipitation levels. In addition, the table below provides a list of IUCN and COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) listed species that use this IBA; population estimates are recent and within the past 5/6 years (2008-2012). Notes: 1) many of the below-mentioned species have sharply declined in numbers since the 1980â€™s and 2) the bird records for this site have not been updated on Canadaâ€™s national IBA website yet.

State of the habitats of the trigger species: This site (http://www.ibacanada.ca/site.jsp?siteID=MB024&lang=EN) is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Manitoba - the driest part of Manitoba. Soils are sandy and some areas are underlain by gravel deposits. Small tracts of native mixed-grass prairie and arid, lowland shrub/scrub are interspersed between agricultural holdings (arable land, perennial crops, orchards & groves, rangelands and pasturelands, abandoned & fallow farmland, disturbed ground). Freshwater pools and streams are found scattered throughout this site. Along the Souris River and its tributaries are coulees of scrub and deciduous riparian woodlands. Much of the area is or has been cultivated at one time or another. The below proportions are approximations. Agriculture (arable/crops and rangelands and pasturelands) 55% Mixed-grass prairie (native grasslands) 20% Freshwater (rivers, streams, small lakes/pools) 10% Scrub/shrub (riparian and other) and deciduous riparian 5% Barren/or sparsely vegetated 5% Developed (urban/commercial) 5%.","There is no unique IBA management/conservation plan or, more broadly, any floral/faunal conservation planning strategies that cover this site (or surrounding areas) and which target grasslands and grassland bird species. However, some agricultural best-practices guidelines and policies exist pertaining to grazing and other agricultural practices (e.g. crop schedules, pollution control/abatement etc.).",0,-,,,,0,-,,,

Livestock grazing is the predominant land use across the speciesâ€™ range in New Mexico and thus plays a major role in determining habitat quality. Grazing that results in insufficient residual grass cover for successful nesting or otherwise lowers recruitment by reducing the availability of good nesting and brood-rearing habitat is considered a threat and may cause population declines (Taylor and Guthery 1980, Applegate and Riley 1998, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998, Leslie et al. 1999, Mote et al. 1999, Bidwell et al. 2001, Jamison et al. 2002). Major Threats: (habitat loss and degradation, small population sizes), Habitat fragmentation, Conversion to cultivated agricultural lands, Intensive livestock grazing, Other Threats: Wind energy and bio-fuel development, Transmission lines, Oil and gas development - (Recent declines in the southern portion of the speciesâ€™ range in New Mexico have led to concern over the effects of fragmentation caused by oil exploration and drilling (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2002b). Fire suppression, Tall structures in prairie (man-made and natural, reduce reproductive success 1), Fence collisions â€“ high mortalities in Oklahoma (39.5%) & New Mexico (26.5%), 80% of CRP acres in the LEPC range are due to expire by 9/30/13 , According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, overall magnitude of threats is high.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Large population declines have occurred since 1800s, primarily due to droughts, conversion of rangeland to cropland, overgrazing by livestock, and chemical control on rangelands. Current range occupied by LEPC is only 14% of that occupied before European settlement and located almost entirely on privately owned land. Recent estimates suggest there are approximately 35,000 birds remaining, many of which are in isolated populations are vulnerable to stochastic environmental conditions. In 1995, with populations down 78% since 1963, LEPC were petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service determined in 1998 that listing was warranted but precluded by other higher priority actions and added LEPC to the candidate species list, and added it to thecandidate species list with a listing priority number (LPN) of 8, on a scale of 1 â€“ 12 based on the magnitude and immediacy of threats. In 2008, due to unregulated wind development and expiration of CRP acreage, the Service increased the LPN from 8 to 2. The Southwest Region (Region 2) is the Serviceâ€™s lead region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has LEPC listed as â€œvulnerableâ€ because of its long and rapid population decline. Finally, The USWFS is currently reviewing the listing decision for the LPN as an endangered speices.

State of the habitats of the trigger species: In New Mexico, Lesser Prairie-Chicken habitat occurs in sand shinnery communities dominated by shin-oak and several species of bluestem, grama, and dropseed grasses. In ungrazed or lightly grazed areas, native tallgrass species such as sand bluestem may grow higher than the relatively low (1-3 ft.) shin-oak canopy. Prairie-Chickens require several distinct habitat types, including open areas for display and mating, dense vegetative cover for nesting, and areas with suitable resources and cover for brood-rearing and winter feeding (Giesen 1998). The supply of safe nest sites is thought to be a primary factor limiting populations. Studies in Chaves County have shown that over large areas containing multiple types of vegetation, Lesser Prairie-Chickens exhibit strong preferences for nesting in shin oak-tallgrass habitat in general, for patches containing the most sand bluestem in the 10-foot diameter area around the nest, and for sand bluestem clumps as nesting cover. Lesser Prairie-Chickens avoid nesting in mesquite and shortgrass-dominated areas where sand bluestem is absent (Davis et. al 1979, Riley et al. 1992). While tall grasses are crucial for nesting cover, shrub cover is also a crucial component of good nesting habitat in New Mexico. Where present, shin-oak may provide a vital part of the annual food supply and is important for shade and escape cover. Successful nests in Chaves County were located in patches in which the vegetation was roughly 65% grasses and 30% shin-oak (Davis et al. 1979, Riley et al. 1992). The Lesser Prairie-Chicken Complex in eastern New Mexico encompasses a number of properties managed specifically for prairie-chickens. These properties include federal and state lands as well as a preserve owned by The Nature Conservancy. Global IBA habitat designation as determined by habitat layers map: Irreplaceable Habitat = 648,885 acres Limiting Habitat = 1,023,530 acres Significant Habitat = 790,654 acres * The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish owns 29 properties designated as â€œPrairie Chicken Wildlife Areasâ€ covering over 23,000 acres, as well as the 5,000-acre Sandhills Prairie Conservation Area. * The Bureau of Land Management recently established the 57,000-acre Lesser-Prairie Chicken Area of Critical Environmental Concern and has closed an additional 163,000 acres to new oil and gas leasing. * The Nature Conservancyâ€™s Milnesand Prairie Preserve protects 18,500 acres of prairie-chicken habitat. Some other private land owners have voluntarily implemented conservation measures benefitting prairie-chickens on their properties, through programs such as the Landowner Incentive Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, and Candidate Conservation Agreements. New Mexico state law protects the confidentiality of lek locations on private land. Access to state and federal lands managed for prairie-chickens is restricted during the breeding season (mid-February through June). The shinnery oak-sand dune-grassland habitats utilized by Lesser Prairie-Chickens in New Mexico are also home to other declining grassland species such as Burrowing Owl, Scaled Quail, and both Cassinâ€™s and Grasshopper Sparrow. The boundaries of this IBA also encompass Grulla National Wildlife Refuge. When water levels are high, the playa lake at the heart of this refuge can host thousands of migrating Sandhill Cranes as well as numerous waterfowl and shorebirds. The boundaries of this IBA are based on the Western Governorâ€™s Association Southern Great Plains Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool (SGP-CHAT), a state-of-the-art conservation planning tool that identifies priority habitat for the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (available at http://www.kars.ku.edu/geodata/maps/sgpchat/). This tool builds on previous mapping efforts of the Natural Heritage New Mexico program and Playa Lakes Joint Venture, as well as numerous long-range conservation planning efforts including those of the Lesser Prairie Chicken Interstate Working Group (LPCIWG). The IBA boundaries for the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Complex in New Mexico include all areas mapped by the SGP-CHAT as having the following habitat designations: Irreplaceable, Limiting, and Significant. According to the LPCIWGâ€™s 2008 Lesser Prairie Chicken Conservation Initiative (pp. 70-71), â€œConservation of LEPC [in New Mexico] requires large, contiguous patches of native rangeland be protected and managed largely or exclusively as LEPC habitat. â€¦ Such protected areas should not be limited to east-central New Mexico where stable LEPC populations currently exist. Habitat acquisition in areas where isolated and sparse and scattered populations occur is particularly important to prevent further fragmentation and to help maintain or re-establish habitat patches capable of supporting viable LEPC populations in these areas. Protected areas should form a broad network, linked wherever possible by habitat corridors to maintain or re-establish connectivity between populations.â€ The SGP-CHAT map identifies important core population areas as well as corridors that could facilitate dispersal and reduce habitat fragmentation. The SGP-CHAT map also will be updated regularly, as new information becomes available about lands currently designated as â€œUnknownâ€ due to incomplete data, and as land-use changes and restoration efforts change the landscape inhabited by the prairie-chickens. Tying the IBA to this ongoing, cooperative effort will allow the IBA boundaries and associated conservation efforts to remain current as conditions on the ground change.","The Lesser Prairie-Chicken Complex in eastern New Mexico encompasses a number of properties managed specifically for prairie-chickens.

As a result, habitat quality continues to diminish and the acres impacted continue to expand. Water management decisions also have negative consequences for the region, leading to periods of unnatural high and low water levels. Everglades National Park: The hydrology of the Park has been disrupted for agriculture and flood-control, which has severely impacted its wildlife and the health of the park and Florida Bay. While restoration efforts are underway, they have been substantially delayed and land once proposed to be used for restoration projects has been developed. As in the Northern Everglades, phosphorus pollution is a concern. Debates continue about how to deliver more water to the park while avoiding negative impacts caused by increasing phosphorus levels.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Everglades National Park is the most ornithologically diverse site in Florida, supporting 344 native species. It is estimated that wading bird numbers have declined by 90% of historical numbers, even though the spatial extent of wetland decline is only 50%. The reason the bird decline is larger than the wetland decline is the remaining wetlands have such impaired hydrology that they are poor wading b ird habitat. Numerous significant bird species inhabitat the Park for all or part of the year including Bald Eagles, Everglade and Swallow-tailed Kites, shorebirds, perhaps half of the state's breeding White-crowned Pigeons (with many other Carribean species), and perhaps most of the world's population of Cape Sable Seaside Sparrows. More than 20 species of wintering wood warblers are reported annually, giving the Everglades National Park one of the greatest diversity of wintering wood-warblers in North America.

Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge (145,787 acres; 58,999 hectares), East Coast Buffer (15,164 acres; 6136 hectares), Everglades Buffer Strip North (1155 acres; 467 hectares), Everglades and Francis S. Taylor Wildlife Management Area (671,831 acres; 271,890 hectares), Holey Land Wildlife Management Area (35,350 acres; 14,306 hectares), Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area (27,810 acres; 11,254 hectares), and Talisman property (51,210 acres; 20,724 hectares). Private lands are sought for public acquisition through the East Everglades CARLFF Project (104,615 acres unacquired; 42,337 hectares) and Stormwater Treatment Areas SOR project (47,630 acres; 19,275 ha, with 45,519 acres acquired; 18,421 hectares).Much of southern and western Palm Beach County, central and western Broward County, and northwestern Miami-Dade County, from the Everglades Agricultural Area south to Everglades National Park. A vast area of Everglades marsh and agricultural lands part of Everglades restoration north of, and contiguous with, Everglades National Park. Most of the marsh portions of this IBA are accessible only via airboat. Many of the sites are State-owned Water Conservation Areas managed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission as Wildlife Management Areas. Water Conservation Area 1 is leased to the Federal Government as the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, which was established in 1951. The Refuge originally was connected to the Loxahatchee River via Loxahatchee Slough, but this connection has been destroyed by urban development. The Refuge receives 305,000 recreationists and 200 hunters annually. Information was not provided for any site within this IBA other than Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Habitats: Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge: wet prairie (56,478 acres; 22,856 hectares), sawgrass marsh (28,042 acres; 11,348 hectares), tree islands (21,915 acres; 8869 hectares), cattail marshes (5726 acres; 2317 hectares), freshwater impoundments (700 acres; 283 hectares), cypress swamp (400 acres; 161 hectares), open water (282 acres; 114 hectares), and sloughs (272 acres; 110 hectares). Everglades National Park: Located at the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula, in western Miami-Dade County and virtually all of mainland Monroe County, ranging from Everglades City in the northeast to Florida City in the southwest. The Park is 43 miles (70 km) east to west and the same distance north to south. U.S. Highway 41 east of the Forty-Mile Bend forms the Park's northern boundary, while its southern boundary extends into Florida Bay, including dozens of small keys, and approaches to within a few miles (km) of the Mainline Florida Keys. Contiguous with the Big Cypress Swamp Watershed IBA to the north, and near the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge IBAs to the northwest. At 1,507,850 acres (610,226 hectares), Everglades National Park is the largest single conservation area in Florida, and certainly is one of the world's best-known natural treasures. It is an extremely diverse area and receives over 1,000,000 recreationists annually, of which one-third are from other countries. The former fishing village of Flamingo now contains a campground, visitor's center, and living quarters for Park employees. The entire Greater Everglades Ecosystem is the targeted for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), the largest ecosystem restoration project in history, expected to cost more than $8 billion and take 30-50 years to complete. This IBA also includes over 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) of adjacent marshland purchased to improve water flow to the park and to buffer it from development. These sites are the Frog PondL-31 Transition Lands portion of the East Everglades CARLFF Project (6853 acres [2773 hectares] acquired as Frog Pond Wildlife Management Area), Southern Glades SOR Tract (30,722 acres; 12,433 hectares), and the 8.5 Square-Mile Area (5440 acres; 2201 ha, some acquired). Habitats: sawgrass marsh, tidal marsh, tropical hammock, mangrove forest, estuarine, cypress swamp, slash pine flatwoods, bayhead, freshwater marsh, cattail marsh, riverine, lacustrine, coastal strand, artificial.","The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is a series of more than 60 projects that was approved in 2000 as the largest ecosystem restoration plan on earth. Of these 60 projects however, only four are under construction. The effort has been largely stalled due to budgetary restrictions and other issues. The Site 1 Reservoir project will improve habitat within the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and the Melaleuca eradication project will help combat this invasive species throughout the ecosystem. Other restoration projects that are not part of CERP are also progressing, including the C-111 Spreader Canal (SC) project in the southeastern region, bridging over Tamiami Trail, removing the barrier to water flow into Everglades National Park and the expansion of thousands of acres of Stormwater Treatment Areas between the Everglades Agricultural Area and Everglades National Park to remove phosphorus from water before it flows into the Everglades. Yet, the core Everglades areas, including the Water Conservation Areas, Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park itself, continue to suffer from severely degraded hydrology and nutrient contamination. The lack of reliable water flow through the â€œRiver of Grassâ€ is allowing the erosion of the ridge and slough landscape structure, a defining characteristic of the Everglades that may not be restorable if lost. Similarly, human-enhanced droughts allow fires to destroy the organic soils of the Everglades that took eons to form. And because the Everglades is virtually at sea level, a nine-inch rise in sea level in the last few decades has caused salt water encroachment into the Everglades, increasing the urgency to restore and increase freshwater flows throughout the system. To reinvigorate and accelerate the restoration process, state and federal agencies have undertaken an accelerated planning process entitled the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) to bundle essential core Everglades projects in order to bring more water, with appropriate patterns and nutrient levels, back into the central Everglades. The project is in the planning stages and hopefully will be sent to Congress by 2014. With a price tag greater than $1 billion and a construction schedule likely lasting more than a decade, many challenges remain as the Everglades continues to deteriorate. Beyond the water problems that threaten this wetland complex, exotic plant and animal species have readily invaded south Florida due to its sub-tropical character. One of the most critical challenges at present is the fast-expanding population of pythons and other exotic snakes which are taking a toll on small mammals and wading birds within Everglades National Park. The generally warm weather in south Florida allows the reptiles to remain hidden in dense vegetation where they are difficult to find and eradicate. A special hunting event was organized in February 2013 in an attempt to reduce they exotic snake population and to collect abundance data but the event did not yield as many kills as Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission organizers expected. Although residential and commercial construction cannot occur within designated wildlife refuges or parks, urban intensification continues in areas surrounding these preserves. The main threat is water quality deterioration and inappropriate timing of flows from the large quantities of stormwater runoff. Stormwater detention and retention facilities are required with new development but those structures are of little consequence during tropical storm events with heavy rainfall. Non-point source pollution from agricultural crops and animal husbandry operations are an ongoing and severe challenge to the health of the Everglades ecosystem and to the forage fish and bird populations. Increased flows to the Everglades from Lake Okeechobee will be needed but the Lakeâ€™s water quality continues to worsen, increasing the costs and challenges of restoration proportionally. Audubon Florida policy staff and research biologists are actively involved in all aspects of Everglades policy and water quality issues and are actively involved in research on forage fish and bird populations.",119121,confirmed,2009,,A4i,0,-,,,

As a result, habitat quality continues to diminish and the acres impacted continue to expand. Water management decisions also have negative consequences for the region, leading to periods of unnatural high and low water levels. Everglades National Park: The hydrology of the Park has been disrupted for agriculture and flood-control, which has severely impacted its wildlife and the health of the park and Florida Bay. While restoration efforts are underway, they have been substantially delayed and land once proposed to be used for restoration projects has been developed. As in the Northern Everglades, phosphorus pollution is a concern. Debates continue about how to deliver more water to the park while avoiding negative impacts caused by increasing phosphorus levels.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Everglades National Park is the most ornithologically diverse site in Florida, supporting 344 native species. It is estimated that wading bird numbers have declined by 90% of historical numbers, even though the spatial extent of wetland decline is only 50%. The reason the bird decline is larger than the wetland decline is the remaining wetlands have such impaired hydrology that they are poor wading b ird habitat. Numerous significant bird species inhabitat the Park for all or part of the year including Bald Eagles, Everglade and Swallow-tailed Kites, shorebirds, perhaps half of the state's breeding White-crowned Pigeons (with many other Carribean species), and perhaps most of the world's population of Cape Sable Seaside Sparrows. More than 20 species of wintering wood warblers are reported annually, giving the Everglades National Park one of the greatest diversity of wintering wood-warblers in North America. As a final fueling-stop for southward trans-Gulf migrants, and first re-fueling stop for returning birds, the Everglades are an unusually important migratory link for North and South American avifauna.

Contaminants include selenuium, boron, and DDE, that leaches out of the Imperial Valley, where many of the areaâ€™s birds feed, and into the Sea. Sporadic human intrusions can devastate colonies of nesting birds. For land birds, habitat clearing remains a serious threat. The few remaining populations of Crissal Thrasher, Lucyâ€™s Warbler, and other native scrub-dwelling species are seeing tract after tract cleared for agriculture, particularly at the north and northwest ends of the sea. Tamarisk invasion of riparian draws remains a chronic threat to healthy populations of desert nesters and to freshwater marsh birds. Many governmental and NGO groups have met for at least a decade to devise restoration plans to restore or save portions of the Salton Sea, but to date due to lack of funding, nothing has been implemented on a large scale.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: Several bird species occur regularly here and nowhere else in western North America, contributing to the exceptionally high year-round diversity of birds here. These include one breeding species, Laughing Gull; two regular, post-breeding visitors: Wood Stork and Yellow-footed Gull; and a migrant and winter-resident shorebird, Stilt Sandpiper. The rare vanrossemii race of Gull-billed Tern breeds in the U.S. only here and at San Diego Bay. The wintering population of Eared Grebes on the Sea is the largest concentration in the world (estimates range from 0.3 to 3.5 million birds), and they are joined by thousands of Western and Clarkâ€™s grebes, likely the largest aggregation of these two species in California. Each summer, tens of thousands of American White Pelicans descend on the Sea, in all about 30% of the North American breeding population. Mullet Island, near the mouth of the Alamo River, hosts one of the largest breeding colonies of Double-crested Cormorants in western North America. About 40% of the U.S. population of Yuma Clapper Rail, essentially a lower Colorado River endemic, occurs in marshes at the edge of the sea. The 2-300 resident Western Snowy Plover represent one of the largest aggregations in the interior of the U.S., with most of the birds concentrated along the shoreline and adjacent alkali flats in the southwest and southeast corners of the sea. The thousands of Black Terns summering (but not breeding) on the Sea may be the largest concentration in North America. To the south, Imperial Valley is significant for a number of species that have become reliant on an agricultural landscape. Almost 90% of Californiaâ€™s wintering Mountain Plovers are found here, representing possibly 30% of the global population and the stateâ€™s largest breeding population of Burrowing Owl nests along the levees. The fields are utilized by gulls, and Gull-billed Terns, and large roosts of White-faced Ibis, Cattle Egrets and many species of shorebirds. The delta sand spits along the southeastern shore of the Salton Sea support thousands of roosting cormorants and pelicans (Brown Pelican has bred recently, and in very low numbers). Several hundred pairs of nesting gulls and terns, including Black Skimmer, are found either at the Whitewater River mouth or at Rock Hill on the southern shore. Land bird populations are strongest in remaining areas of native desert scrub or riparian habitat, including along the main rivers and creeks leading into the sea, and within the Torres Martinez Indian Reservation on the north side of the Sea. State of the habitats of the trigger species: The Salton Sea, a global IBA of 235,000 acres in size, was formed in 1905 when a break in a canal from the Colorado River filled the Salton Trough, and has since become arguably the most important body of water for birds in the interior of California. Ecologically, it may be thought of as the northern terminus of the Gulf of California, or an alternate flood plain/delta for the lower Colorado River, itself once among the most ecologically vital biomes in the Southwest. As scientists and conservationists discuss ways to save the sea by reducing salinity and preventing mass die-offs of birds, the Sea quietly waits, and shrinks in size. Three main rivers flow into the sea, one in the north and two from the south. The Whitewater River emerges from steep, rocky slopes high in the San Bernardino Mtns. to the northwest and runs year-round nearly to the floor of the Colorado Desert north of Palm Springs. By the time it flows through the Coachella Valley, run-off from over a hundred golf courses and thousands of acres of melon and grapefruit orchards quench its thirst before it meets the warm, brownish brine of the sea, just south of the village of Mecca. In the south, the New and the Alamo Rivers flow from the Imperial Valley to form vast deltas at the southeastern end of the sea, where there are also several large islands just offshore. The shore of the sea is generally un-vegetated (the water is too salty to support much vegetation), although thickets of non-native tamarisk grow at creek mouths and around impoundments, particularly along its southeastern shore. Politically, the sea is a mosaic of 90% public ownership that includes Indian tribal lands (northwest), an inactive DoD training range (southwest), the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge (south and southeast), Salton Sea State Park (northeast), and various private holdings. The Imperial Valley IBA, adjacent to the southern end of the Salton Sea, is a global IBA of 640,000 acres in size that by contrast is 92% privately owned farmland consistently of cultivated crops and pasture/hay. The two areas are linked in that many birds move daily between the fields for feeding and nesting islands within the sea. They are also linked hydrologically.","Audubon Californiaâ€™s proposed conservation goals at the Salton Sea are to: maintain and create wetlands along the margins of Salton Sea in the face of a shrinking sea; restart the Salton Sea restoration council that was created by Audubon, but was not approved by the current California State Governor; create and implement a restoration plan; and secure a funding source to restore/sequire a reliable water supply to the Salton Sea (Audubon will also propose to put Salton Sea in the state water bond).

They are also linked hydrologically.","Audubon California proposed conservation goals at the Salton Sea are to: maintain and create wetlands along the margins of Salton Sea in the face of a shrinking sea; restart the Salton Sea restoration council that was created by Audubon, but was not approved by the current California State Governor; create and implement a restoration plan; and secure a funding source to restore/sequire a reliable water supply to the Salton Sea (Audubon will also propose to put Salton Sea in the state water bond). Audubon goals for the Imperial Valey are to maintain compatible agriculture, particularly for Burrowing Owl and Mountain Plover.",119093,confirmed,2009,,"A4i, A4iii",0,-,,,

The IBA is not protected and its borders are not clearly defined within the large areas of degraded forest in east Kadavu, enabling easy encroachment from the logged forests and agriculture around the IBA. This erosion of the main forest block may accelerate if the area attracts infrastructural development such as more tourism facilities and a proposed airstrip.    As elsewhere in Fiji, logging roads allow increased access into the forest by invasive alien mammals. Cats are likely to predate Collared Petrel eggs and chicks, and rats are likely to predate various tree-nesting species. The island is currently mongoose-free, but their invasion from the main Fijian island of Viti Levu represents perhaps the greatest threat to Kadavu's seabirds and landbirds.   People report the continuing traditional practice of harvesting Collared Petrels for food. Evidence from Correia (1927-1929) and V. Masibalavu (pers. comm.) suggests this has had a significant impact on petrel populations within the IBA. ","Extensive forests remain in east Kadavu but many have been logged, encroached by agriculture or burned. The East Kadavu IBA is the largest block of old-growth lowland and lower montane forest on the island. The terrain is rugged and includes the second and third highest peaks on Kadavu, Mt Niabutubutu at 634 m and Mt Biloniyaqona. The higher peaks and steeper slopes support montane forest, sometimes with long slender kiki reeds on the highest peaks. This slowly merges into lowland rainforest across most of the IBA. Forest at the lowest altitudes is dryer, becoming semi-deciduous forest in the driest areas along the north coast, but most of this has been extensively degraded. The IBA is bounded by degraded, mostly logged forest with some agricultural incursions. Old-growth forests extend down to 100 m in some places, but only to 400 m elsewhere. The main threat to East Kadavuâ€™s birds is forest degradation by logging, fire and agricultural expansion. The IBA is not protected and its borders are not clearly defined within the large areas of degraded forest in east Kadavu, enabling easy encroachment from the logged forests and agriculture around the IBA.

On June 6 1925 Correia (1927-1929) recorded:   â€œmany old holes, no birds inside. - only  birds found all gray backed; - people went 3 times a week to get [petrels] to eat ; - they start coming in March, and during March and April the people kill many hundreds and take eggs, but they stop killing in May in order to give the younger birds a chance to grow up. In June they start killing the young ones for eating, so this is the reason that very few are left in the holes; - collected about 20 in 2 days.â€   Harvesting was still reported in east Kadavu in the 1980s (Watling 1986) and 2004 (V. Masibalavu pers. comm.) and may continue today. It is noteworthy that by 2004 the numbers harvested were at least an order of magnitude lower than Correia (1927-1929) reports from 1925 (V.

There appear to be no cliffs or inaccessible mountainous ledges on Gau where petrels could nest out of the reach of these predators. Research is urgently needed to locate the petrel nesting grounds, to monitor breeding success and the impact of these predators. Fortunately, Gau lacks mongoose but conservation action needs to include preventative measures to ensure that they do not colonise from nearby Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.   Considerable effort has been applied to the location of breeding grounds for Fiji and Collared Petrels. Monitoring using spot-lights at night has failed to record Fiji Petrel but provides data on annual variation in Collared Petrel numbers and timing of activity at the island. Searches using burrow scopes were unsuccessful at locating nesting burrows but the use of trained search dogs in 2011 and 2012 has successfully located over 50 burrows to date.  Predator control has been implemented around known nesting burrows of Collared Petrel to improve breeding success.    Single Fiji petrels continue to be grounded in villages. In 2012 the first vocalisations of Fiji Petrel were recorded from one such individual. This recording may help in future spot-lighting searches and with searches elsewhere in Fiji.   In 2012 remote playback equipment was installed at a site on Gau to broadcast the calls of threatened petrels. Artificial nesting burrows have been installed at the same site in the hope a known population can be established at which predator control can be implemented.   There may be potential for a low level of specialised ecotourism to cater for interested ornithologists as and when the Fiji Petrel nesting grounds have been located.   NatureFiji-MareqetiViti staff have been managing Fiji and Collared Petrel conservation efforts on Gau, training individuals from local communities to support the programme and implement specific conservation activities. Local communities have received training in reporting grounded petrels and ensuring they are handled and released without harm to the birds.

Subsequently they were identified as an important breeding site for Red-footed Booby with Brown Booby also present during a 1983 visit Jenkins 1986).   On Kibobolevu, seven land birds were recorded during a 2007 survey (NatureFiji-MareqetiViti 2007). The WSSE collected only on this island and recorded six species, however, two of which the white-throated pigeon and the Vanikoro broadbill were not observed on this survey. Of the two, it is surprising that the Vaniknoro broadbill was not observed if it still occurs on the island as it is usually common where it occurs. Further survey is needed to confirm their apparent absence. The observations on Kiboboiloma were the first ever on this island, five species were recorded. No observations were made on Kibobolailai. The survey made additions to the WSSE list of birds from Kiboboiloma. Despite the short period on the island, the loss of the Vanikoro broadbill from Kibobolevu is a distinct possibility given the season, as noted above. The orange-breasted myzomela had been collected on Sovulevu by the WSSE, but was not observed during the four hours spent on the islet, too short a period to consider it potentially absent.   The smallest of the three Kibobo islets was not visited in 2007 but no seabird activity was seen on it or flying over it. A small number of red-footed boobys are nesting on Kiboboiloma (c 20 pairs), but Kibobolevu has a large colony, of approximately 2,000 nesting pairs. In addition approximately 20 brown booby breeding pairs were observed (NatureFiji-MareqetiViti 2007).","No conservation actions have been implemented at this site.

However, cyclones have been prevalent in the area for millenia and are unlikely to represent a significant threat to the site.   Reinvasion by invasive species represents a considerable threat owing to the proximity of the site to the mainland, and the frequency of visits by fishers. These visits also have the potential to cause disturbance to breeding seabirds.","Tarburton (1978) carried out observations on seabird breeding in Fiji. In June and July 1975 he compiled a list of numbers of occupied and unoccupied seabird nests present on Mabualau, which included 270 occupied nests of Red-footed Booby, 6 unoccupied Brown Booby, 70 unoccupied Lesser Frigatebird, 28 unoccupied Reef Heron, 1 unoccupied Brown Noddy and 2,600 Black Noddy nests. In July 1976 he listed 350 unoccupied Red-footed Booby, 2 occupied Reef Heron, 10 unoccupied Reef Heron, and 40 unoccupied Black Noddy nests. Langham (1984) censused the Red-footed Booby (Sula sula) population repeatedly between 1980 and 1982 with counts of 246 (July), 173 (October), 118 (November), 394 (March), 300 (August), 340 (August), 397 (October), 17 (February) and 293 (June) nests during the period. Langham also counted other breeding bird species on Mabualau such as Reef Heron (Egretta sacra) and Slaty Monarch (Mayrornis lessoni) and non-breeding species such as Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata ariel), Brown Booby (Sula leucogaster), Swamp Harrier (Circus approximans), Black Noddy (Anous minutus), Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Collard Kingfisher (Todiramphus chloris), Fiji Shrikebill(Clytorhynchus vitiensis), Vanikoro Broadbill( Myiagra vanikoroensis), Jungle Mynah( Acridotheres fuscus), Orange-breasted Myzomela (Myzomela jugularis) and Silvereye (Zosterops lateralis).   Seabird were surveyed by a team from BirdLife Internationalâ€™s Fiji Programme on 10-13 April, 2007. The average number of nests on Mabualau was calculated to be 89 per hectare which was extrapolated to give a total number of 297 nests for Mabualau. About 92% of Red-footed Booby nests found occurred on Pisonia grandis. Only 8% were found on Ficus smithii.   Lesser Frigatebirds (Fregata ariel) were estimated to total approximately 500 individuals in 2007. Estimates were derived from snapshots taken in which the rafting groups averaged 166 birds per snapshot. Frigatebirds started coming in from 16.45 hours from somewhere south and settled down to roost on the island during twilight. No evidence of nesting was seen.    Mabualau is also utilised as a roosting site by non-breeding Black Noddies (Anous minutus). It was noted that on two evenings of reasonably good weather, the birds streamed in from two directions from somewhere west and north-west from 18.20 to 18.40 and departed in the mornings around 04.30. (BirdLife International (2007) estimated the number of roosting Black Noddies to exceed the IBA A4iii threshold of >20,000 waterbirds, but there is little solid evidence to support this assessment and no subsequent or previous counts have approached these numbers.   About 100 nesting Crested Terns (Sterna bergii) were estimated to be on nearby Saqata rocks. Saqata consists of three rock islets separated approximately three metres from each other by narrow channels in a quarter hectare area. This represents one of a very few known colonies of the species in Fiji.","Pacific Rat (Rattus exulans) was eradicated from Mabualau in 2008 (Seniloli 2008). Subsequent monitoring surveys are warranted in an attempt to clarify the number of Black Noddies that use the site during the non-breeding season. Given the risk of reinvasion by rats biosecurity measures should be put in place and the presence of invasive species checked during monitoring visits.   As a predator free site Mabualau represents an important resource for seabird conservation in Fiji and attempts to attract threatened seabirds to the site to nest are recommended.   A shed has been established by landowners to discourage cutting of trees and clearing campsites. A recent taboo has been set on overnight fishing in the Bau waters (qoliqoli), set by the Bau Tikina council in an effort to manage over fishing issues. The Taboo has reduced use of the island for over-night camping.",129967,candidate,2012,A4i,,0,-,,,

With increasing human population pressure, there is slow ongoing clearance of forest for agricultural land. People are being forced to walk further to their gardens and would welcome help to improve the productivity of land closer to the villages which should reduce the pressure for further clearance. Alternative income activities such as promoting tourist treks to the summit could help to demonstrate an economic reason for conserving the forest and its birds and relieve the agricultural expansion. It is unlikely that the limited human pressure will impact on the steep slopes and summit. However, there is evidence of feral cats on the summit and they are likely to predate any ground-nesting seabirds, notably Collared Petrel. These seabirds urgently require surveying and may need protection against cats and other invasive alien mammals. Kadavu Shining Parrots may be affected by the collection of nestlings for local use as pets. An investigation into the numbers collected and destinations for any traded birds should be undertaken across Kadavu.","Nabukelevu is the only known site in Fiji from where the White-throated Storm-petrel has been recorded breeding, but this relates to an historic record from 1876 (Finsch 1877). At Nabukelevu/Mt. Washington Kleinschmidt (1879) reported Collared Petrels â€œvisiting their nests, encircled the mountain peak as though wishing to express their astonishment at our fires.â€ Although Kleinschmidtâ€™s (1879) account doesnâ€™t provide any estimate of numbers, it suggests Collared Petrel was not uncommon at the time of his visit. This is no longer the case with surveys in 2003 failing to detect any individuals. Subsequently a concerted effort in 2012 to conduct monthly visits to spot-light petrels at night during peak months of activity small numbers, suggesting tens of pairs, have been detected. These surveys also recorded Tahiti Petrel at the site for the first time.   Nabukelevu supports all the four species and eight subspecies endemic to Kadavu, including good numbers of Kadavu Honeyeaters and probably the largest population of the montane Island Thrush subspecies T. p. ruficeps.    Current breeding colonies of seabirds on the headland west of Davigele and other rocky headlands are thought to be Wedge-tailed Shearwaters not Collared Petrels. Two other globally threatened species that occur on Kadavu, Friendly Ground-dove (VU) and Black-faced Shrikebill (VU), are likely to occur in small numbers in old-growth forest at lower altitudes.   A1 Globally threatened species   * [Polynesian Storm-petrel (EN) â€“ one breeding record in September 1876; current status unknown]   * Kadavu Shining Parrot (VU) â€“ common in adjacent agricultural land, probably nesting in the IBA  * Collared Petrel (VU) â€“ occurs in small numbers with breeding suspected   * Whistling Dove (NT) â€“ fairly common at lower altitudes   * Kadavu Fantail (NT) â€“ common, especially at lower altitudes   A2 Restricted-range species  15 species (out of 18 on Kadavu and 36 in Fiji), including all four endemic to Kadavu.    [A4ii Congregatory seabird species - Collared Petrel â€“ may meet the threshold of >10 pairs]  ","People are being forced to walk further to their gardens and would welcome help to improve the productivity of land closer to the villages which should reduce the pressure for further clearance. Alternative income activities such as promoting tourist treks to the summit could help to demonstrate an economic reason for conserving the forest and its birds and relieve the agricultural expansion. It is unlikely that the limited human pressure will impact on the steep slopes and summit.    A Site Support Group has been established comprising members of the local land-owning communities. They have engaged in a number of income generating activities to reduce pressure on exploiting timber resources within the IBA. Notably bee-keeping and honey production, pineapple growing and producing sandalwood seedlings for sale.   An investigation into the numbers of Kadavu Shining Parrot collected and destinations for any traded birds should be undertaken across Kadavu.   In 2012 a monitoring programme was implemented for Collared Petrel and artificial nest-boxes and a sound system playing petrel calls every night at the summit were installed to try to establish a petrel population for which research and management activities can be implemented.",129968,confirmed,2012,,"A1, A2, A4ii",0,-,,,

Other potential threats to the islands are the presence and introduction of invasive species and over-harvesting. Rats (Rattus spp.) have been introduced to Fana since 1998, and are likely to have a detrimental impact on ground-nesting seabirds. ","Fana is under traditional management and harvesting of resources, especially birds, turtles, and coconut crabs, is prohibited. Distance to and access from the main Palau archipelago is anticipated to be the biggest challenge of conservation planning and management.

The area has also suffered from coral bleaching. The low-lying island is susceptible to storms and other natural disasters and therefore climate change, which may increase the frequency of these events poses a significant threat.     The reintroduction of non-native mammals poses a risk to the islands biodiversity. The Singapore Ant was introduced to Helen by confiscated fishing canoes from Indonesia and the Philippines. This ant presents one of the biggest threats to the islandâ€™s biodiversity, especially to the nesting seabirds. Other introduced species which may threaten the islandsâ€™ birds and biodiversity are introduced dogs and chickens.   The problem of seabird harvesting may now be controlled by permanent rangers stationed on the island but this had a major impact in the past. Kepler (1992) reported excessive human molestation, peaking in spring 1992, decimated Helen's seabird populations from an estimated 91,000 to 95,000 (9 species) in 1979 to 5700-7100 (2 species) by 1992. Sooty Tern egging, primarily for commercial profit, was responsible for the majority of losses, but breeding and non-breeding populations of 5 species dropped drastically, including all the large seabirds: Red-footed and Brown Boobies, Great Frigatebird, Black-naped Tern, and Sooty Terns. Several of these seabirds breed in Palauan waters only in the SW Islands, at Helen and/or Fanna. Helen's Crested Tern colony, was disturbed daily by residents for fresh eggs; over 600 eggs were already abandoned during a visit in 1992.  ","This island is one of only two IBAs in Palau that qualifies under the A4 criteria for significant congregations of seabirds. Helen Island qualifies as an IBA because of its congregations of nesting Black Noddies. Recent studies have estimated 20,000 nesting birds (Helen Reef 2004; Knecht 2005). The island also has Palau's largest nesting population of Great Crested Terns (5,000-7,000). Thousands of Red-footed Boobies and Brown Boobies used to nest on the island, but have moved to an abandoned barge on the nearby reef because of past human disturbance. The Sooty Tern population which numbered 82,000 individuals in 1979 had been decimated but 1992 owing to frequent disturbance and harvesting (Kepler 1992) but may now be recovering.","Helen Reef Conservation Area which includes the island, entire lagoon and surrounding reefs, covers an area of 262 km2 and is protected under Hatohobei state legislation, which created a board that oversees management of the area. Access to the main archipelago for human resources and supplies remains the greatest management challenge. In 2000 Black Rats (Rattus rattus) were successfully eradicated (Island Conservation 2012). A feasibility study was carried out in 2006 to assess options for eradicating the introduced invasive Singapore Ant (Monomorium destructor) but no eradication attempt has been reported (Pacific Invasives Initiative 2012). The presence of resident rangers on the island has had a significant impact on improving enforcement and monitoring of this protected area reducing the disturbance to and harvest of seabirds.

Un mayor incremento de la actividad forestal producirÃ­a un mayor impacto sobre la biodiversidad, afectando el hÃ¡bitat reproductivo de algunas especies de aves amenazadas, asÃ­ como la dispersiÃ³n y movilidad de los individuos. La conectividad del rÃ­o Aguapey con los esteros del IberÃ¡ es un factor clave que se debe preservar como corredor funcional para la fauna para evitar un aislamiento de la cuenca de Aguapey de los grandes pastizales inundables del Ibera. Se recomienda delimitar un Ã¡rea de reserva en la cuenca del Aguapey y desarrollar un ordenamiento territorial que permita el mantenimiento de la importante biodiversidad presente junto con el desarrollo de las actividades productivas tradicionales sobre los ambientes mejor conservados. En 2003 los pastizales de la cuenca de Aguapey han sido sugeridos como un sitio prioritario para el establecimiento de reservas compensatorias de la represa de YacyretÃ¡. La inundaciÃ³n de la represa ha cubierto ambientes que contenÃ­an poblaciones de aves amenazadas que hoy se encuentran en el Aguapey en condiciones viables, y que no estÃ¡n bien representadas en las actuales unidades de conservaciÃ³n consideradas como compensatorias de la represa (Unidad de ConservaciÃ³n Galarza, Reserva RincÃ³n Santa MarÃ­a). La ganaderÃ­a tradicional parece no comprometer la viabilidad de las poblaciones de aves globalmente amenazadas, aunque en algunos establecimientos se observa un proceso de modernizaciÃ³n con drenaje de malezales e implantaciÃ³n de pasturas que podrÃ­a tener algÃºn efecto sobre las aves. Algunas de las estancias que poseen las mejores poblaciones de especies amenazadas y un buen estado de conservaciÃ³n del hÃ¡bitat son La Sirena, El OmbÃº, Santa MarÃ­a del Aguapey, San Antonio, La Higuera, ParaÃ­so, Santa Teresa, El Carmen y San Miguelito. La cuenca del rÃ­o Aguapey es uno de los dos sitios de Argentina que ha sido identificado como de prioridad mundial para establecimiento de reservas (Global Gap Analysis of Protected Areas).","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: En los pastizales de Aguapey se encuentran poblaciones importantes de aves globalmente amenazadas y endÃ©micas. Se encuentra la mayor poblaciÃ³n de la Argentina del tordo amarillo (Xanthopsar flavus) que vive asociada a los ambientes abiertos del cauce principal del rÃ­o y los baÃ±ados afluentes. En la regiÃ³n central de la cuenca se han contabilizado hasta 300 individuos en censos simultÃ¡neos durante la Ã©poca reproductiva. A lo largo de todo el rÃ­o se estima que podrÃ­a haber 1.000 individuos. Los tordos amarillos nidifican en colonias en los baÃ±ados cercanos al rÃ­o. La monjita dominica (Heteroxolmis dominicana) se encuentra en los mismos sitios que el tordo amarillo. El yetapÃ¡ de collar (Alectrurus risora) habita en casi todos los pastizales de la cuenca, siendo mÃ¡s abundante en los malezales y raro en las lomadas secas. El tachurÃ­ coludo (Culicivora caudacuta) es escaso y se encuentra presente en pastizales hÃºmedos cercanos al rÃ­o y en malezales. Los capuchinos del gÃ©nero Sporophila que tambiÃ©n se consideran globalmente amenazados son localmente muy abundantes en manchones de Paspalum spp. espigados de los sectores inundables de tierras bajas, y tambiÃ©n estÃ¡n presentes en los baÃ±ados en torno al rÃ­o. Se han registrado las cinco especies de capuchino amenazadas, aunque el capuchino de collar (Sporophila zelichi) no es observado regularmente, y se lo ha detectado siempre junto al capuchino pecho blanco (Sporophila palustris). La cachirla dorada (Anthus natterreri) es rara y fue registrada en pastizales de lomadas pero se desconoce su estatus en la zona. En las selvas del rÃ­o y los manchones entre las lomadas se han registrado especies tÃ­picas de la selva paranaense, como el chacurÃº cara negra (Nystalus chacuru), el chupadientes (Conopophaga lineata), el bailarÃ­n azul (Chiroxiphia caudata) y el yapÃº (Psarocolius decumanus) junto con el tordo gigante (Molothrus oryzivorus) que parasita sus nidos.

La presencia de poblaciones de aves globalmente amenazadas y endÃ©micas se complementa con la existencia de la poblaciÃ³n relictual de venado de las pampas (Ozotocerus bezoarticus), que tambiÃ©n se encuentra sin protecciÃ³n. Son frecuentes otros grandes mamÃ­feros amenazados como el aguarÃ¡ guazÃº (Chrysocyon brachyurus) y el ciervo de los pantanos (Blastocerus dichotomus).. State of the habitats of the trigger species: La cuenca del rÃ­o Aguapey se encuentra en el noreste de la provincia de Corrientes, dentro de la ecorregiÃ³n de los Campos y Malezales. El paisaje de la cuenca es una matriz de pastizales naturales hÃºmedos donde predomina la paja colorada (Andropogon lateralis) sobre tierras bajas y llanas con mal drenaje. Son los denominados localmente Â«malezalesÂ» que poseen caracterÃ­sticos canalÃ­culos que rodean las grandes matas de pastos. Las zonas mÃ¡s bajas determinan la formaciÃ³n de pastizales inundados durante gran parte del aÃ±o: son los denominados Â«fofadalesÂ» que se ubican en zonas interiores y luego se encausan en baÃ±ados que desaguan al rÃ­o. En estos pastizales dominan gramÃ­neas del gÃ©nero Paspalum spp. Los baÃ±ados se comunican con el rÃ­o y estÃ¡n densamente vegetados con pajonales de Rhynchospora corymbosa y Panicum spp. En las cercanÃ­as del rÃ­o existen lomadas arenosas recubiertas de pastizales de espartillo (Elionurus muticus) y flechilla (Aristida jubata). En los sectores bajos de las lomadas se asientan manchones o isletas de selva hidrÃ³fila de variable tamaÃ±o. Casi todo el borde del rÃ­o y sus islas interiores presentan una importante selva paranaense, ribereÃ±a o en galerÃ­a en algunos sectores, que durante algunas semanas de la primavera y verano se encuentra completamente inundada por el desborde del rÃ­o. La mayor parte de la cuenca estÃ¡ conformada por propiedades privadas que se dedican a la ganaderÃ­a tradicional sobre pastizales naturales. Se trata de establecimientos grandes, muchas veces mayores a 10.000 ha, con algunos casos de utilizaciÃ³n de pasturas implantadas en pequeÃ±os sectores de lomadas cercanos al rÃ­o. En algunos campos se han realizado obras de drenaje de pastizales inundables, pero es muy probable que debido a la gran extensiÃ³n y el manejo actual de los potreros no se afecte por el momento la presencia de especies de la fauna de gran valor de conservaciÃ³n como son los venados de las pampas (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) y las aves amenazadas de los pastizales. Existen algunas arroceras que suelen represar el agua de los baÃ±ados afluentes del rÃ­o. Con el fin de alimentar las arroceras de la zona se habÃ­a planificado la construcciÃ³n de varias represas en el curso del Aguapey, proyectos que en la actualidad parecen suspendidos. En los Ãºltimos aÃ±os se ha desarrollado la industria forestal, especialmente sobre la margen oriental del rÃ­o, y los sectores mÃ¡s norteÃ±os donde se encuentran los suelos con mayor aptitud. La forestaciÃ³n de pinos y eucalipto en grandes macizos constituye una amenaza para la conservaciÃ³n de la biodiversidad de esta Ã¡rea. Se estima que se ha sustituido el 50% del hÃ¡bitat de pastizal natural de la cuenca y la conversiÃ³n todavÃ­a continÃºa.","EL Proyecto Pastizales estÃ¡ trabajando en el Ã¡rea, siendo Aguapey un sitio piloto de la Alianza del Pastizal.

State of the habitats of the trigger species: Perdices es una localidad ubicada sobre la ruta nacional NÂº 14, unos 20 kilÃ³metros al sur de la ciudad de GualeguaychÃº. Entre la ruta y el rÃ­o Uruguay se extiende un paisaje ondulado (cerca del rÃ­o se conoce como Costa Uruguay Sur) de modelado fluvial constituido por una matriz original de pastizales (Â«flechillaresÂ») con presencia de gramÃ­neas de los gÃ©neros Stipa, Briza, Aristida, Paspalum, Panicum, Bromus, Axonopus y Schizachyrium. TambiÃ©n se presentan sectores con fisonomÃ­a de sabana herbÃ¡cea con parches de bosques abiertos de Ã¡rboles y arbustos espinosos (Prosopis y Acacia), que en las cercanÃ­as de los cursos de agua se hacen mÃ¡s densos. Posiblemente el uso ganadero de los pastizales ha propiciado que muchos de estos pastizales se transformen en bosques abiertos de Ã¡rboles, y que otros se hayan arbustizado con plantas latifoliadas (Baccharis y Eupatorium) cubriendo lotes enteros. Existen muchos pastizales secundarios con dominancia de especies exÃ³ticas de gramÃ­neas y compuestas. En las Ã¡reas de pastizal no hay lagunas ni baÃ±ados de importancia, aunque existe una red de arroyos de gran interÃ©s como hÃ¡bitat reproductivo para las aves. Los ambientes hÃºmedos son mas bien escasos y temporarios, mÃ¡s frecuentes en las cercanÃ­as del rÃ­o Uruguay. El uso de la tierra es netamente rural o agrÃ­cola. Las propiedades son pequeÃ±as, con unas pocas que exceden las 1.000 ha. por ello se encuentra un alto nÃºmero de propietarios y una red de caminos importante.

Los tipos de hábitat comprendidos en el AICA actual incluyen salar, estepa herbácea y estepa arbustiva. Los tres tipos de hábitat mencionados se ven afectados por la actividad minera a gran escala que se desarrolla desde 1993 (Proyecto Fénix, FMC-Minera del Altiplano).     Siguiendo criterios de unidad de cuenca y de recursos críticos –agua dulce- y biodiversidad asociada, se propone ampliar el AICA a la totalidad de la cuenca que cubre aproximadamente 400.000 ha (García et al 2002), incluyendo los tres sistemas o unidades hidrogeológicas que conforman el Salar del Hombre Muerto: Sistema acuífero Salar del Hombre Muerto, del río Los Patos y del río Trapiche.

Logging activities and colonization projects culminate in replacement of the native forests by pasture. The illegal capture of chicks and the selective logging represents serious threats to Guarouba guarouba, that apparently needs high trees cavities to nest. The hunting has as the main targets the cracids, as Mitu tuberosum. Constantly, took place conflicts among loggers, squatters, local communities and environmental patrolling agencies, due to the deforestation and illegal occupation of the land.","State of the IBA-criteria-triggering populations: There is just an estimative for some species of the IBA, that is 30 individuals of each species detailed bellow: Penelope pileata, Ortalis superciliaris and Pyrrhura lepida. For other species the populations are unknown. There are other 17 threatened birds species considering the national red list and it is the priority site for bird conservation in the entire Amazon region.. State of the habitats of the trigger species: This area is in the east of the ParÃ¡ state, next to the border with MaranhÃ£o State, and it is one of the most important remnants at the extreme east of Amazon. The area includes the Indigenous Land Amanaye, between the rivers Surubiju and Ararandeua, whose confluence forms the Capim River. The IBA boundaries correspond to a great patch of forest in the region, except the anthropogenic areas in its surroundings. The predominant vegetation is the Tropical lowland evergreen forest..","There is no Protected Area in the region and SAVE Brasil team received information that there is not any enterprise planned to this area.

Cada aÃ±o el paso de aeronaves aumenta y con esto los impactos sobre la nidificaciÃ³n hasta el punto de perder la capacidad de albergar a la colonia de Piquero en algunos sectores.  Existen zonas de despegue de parapentes  al norte de la colonia que frecuentan paseos sobre los nidos, esta es la principal razÃ³n de la pÃ©rdida masiva de nidos en la zona norte del predio y de disminuciÃ³n en su zona sur. Sumado a esto, el paso de helicÃ³pteros y avionetas privadas se hace cada vez mÃ¡s frecuente y los vuelos a baja altura de cualquier aeronave genera impactos en la nidificaciÃ³n causando el ahuyentamiento de la colonia si el evento es previo a la postura de huevos sin que estas retornen y favorece el ingreso de depredadores que se alimentan de los huevos y pollos, ademÃ¡s de provocar la caÃ­da de polluelos impactando directamente sobre el Ã©xito reproductivo.   PresiÃ³n Inmobiliaria: Actualmente la zona donde se sitÃºa la colonia de Piquero comÃºn (Sula variegata) es de propiedad de dos empresas inmobiliarias que pretenden realizar proyectos en el corto plazo para el desarrollo de segunda vivienda de balneario en su zona costera y muy prÃ³xima a la colonia de piqueros, incluso en algunos sectores se proyecta infraestructura de acceso a travÃ©s del a nidificaciÃ³n.  El Proyecto Quirilluca, zona sur de la colonia, ha determinado un Ã¡rea de conservaciÃ³n insuficiente y sin los estudios previos quedando las zonas de mayor vulnerabilidad con escasos metros de amortiguaciÃ³n ademÃ¡s de instalar un cerco generando una barrera a los piqueros juveniles que utilizan esa zona para aterrizar en condiciones de fuertes vientos evitando su regreso al acantilado y construyendo senderos vehiculares a menos de 20 metros de la nidificaciÃ³n. El proyecto el Alto, zona norte en su ingreso al sistema de evaluaciÃ³n de impacto ambiental ha omitido mÃ¡s del 80% de la nidificaciÃ³n con el fin de poder construir infraestructura en la zona de los nidos y permitir el ingreso masivo de personas al Ã¡rea donde se deberÃ­a desarrollar el 50% de la colonia aproximadamente.   Turismo invasivo: Cada aÃ±o se hace mÃ¡s frecuente la visita de turistas por iniciativa propia al lugar o vÃ­a agencias de turismo. La nidificaciÃ³n no cuenta con la infraestructura y los programas de manejo que aseguren la conservaciÃ³n y el turismo invasivo genera el ahuyentamiento de las aves permitiendo el ingreso de depredadores.   Omisiones municipales: En la ResoluciÃ³n de impacto ambiental del Plano Regulador Comunal de PuchuncavÃ­, la Municipalidad se comprometiÃ³ a generar un plan de manejo para la Zona Especial Natural, que se extiende por todo el borde costero de la comuna y que alberga a la colonia de piqueros. Este instrumento de gestiÃ³n podrÃ­a favorecer la conservaciÃ³n de la especie, sin embargo su ausencia le deja a los privados la responsabilidad total de conservaciÃ³n de la especie.   PÃ©rdida de la cobertura vegetacional:  La contaminaciÃ³n y las intervenciones de actividades inmobiliarias han reducido la cobertura vegetacional lo que favorece el reemplazo por especies exÃ³ticas, anuales y generalistas. Esto disminuye el servicio de refugio y materiales para la construcciÃ³n de nidos por parte de las y aumenta el riesgo de incendios al secarse las plantas anuales.   Uso de Retroexcavadoras en Ã©poca de nidificaciÃ³n: Recientes trabajos durante la Ã©poca de nidificaciÃ³n en el Proyecto Quirilluca realizaron escarpes, movimientos de tierra y de acumulaciÃ³n de esta acercÃ¡ndose en algunas zonas a menos de 20 metros de la nidificaciÃ³n. Esto generÃ³ senderos de penetraciÃ³n cercanos a la nidificaciÃ³n fomentando el turismo invasivo a la zona de nidificaciÃ³n. Cambio de vegetaciÃ³n y zonas mas protegidas.   ExtracciÃ³n de huevos: Se han avistado grupos de personas extrayendo huevos de piquero en los acantilados, sin embargo al no existir fiscalizaciÃ³n no se puede estimar el daÃ±o que produce.   Animales exÃ³ticos:  Perros y gatos depredan sobre la nidificaciÃ³n.   Botes en Ã¡rea de entrenamiento y pesca: Los Piqueros utilizan las zonas contiguas marÃ­timas a la nidificaciÃ³n como lugar de alimentaciÃ³n, descanso y entrenamiento de los juveniles. Es frecuente avistar botes de pescadores artesanales realizando actividades de pesca y de extracciÃ³n de mariscos y crustÃ¡ceos, compitiendo por el espacio y aunque no hay registros podrÃ­a causar muerte incidental de piqueros en redes de pesca.   Riesgo de Incendios.","State of key species: Este Sitio fue identificado por IBAS segÃºn el criterio 4ii  por congregar mÃ¡s del 1% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial del Piquero comÃºn (Sula variegata). El estado de esta poblaciÃ³n en los Acantilados de la Quirilluca se ha visto fuertemente disminuida durante los Ãºltimos aÃ±os. En visitas a terreno se ha podido identificar que los individuos en primavera llegan a los Acantilados de la Quirilluca, pero aparentemente, se ven ahuyentados por las perturbaciones del medio causando una disminuciÃ³n de nidos activos en sectores que antes eran los de mayor importancia. En el Ãºltimo periodo estival estimamos en unos 2000 a 2500 nidos activos valor muy menor al estimado cuando la nidificaciÃ³n se encuentra en buenas condiciones.   State of key habitats: La nidificaciÃ³n del piquero comÃºn (Sula variegata) en los Acantilados de la Quirilluca suele extenderse en buenas condiciones por una distancia de dos kilÃ³metros aproximadamente con una capacidad de albergar alrededor de 6.000 parejas de piquero comÃºn (12.000 individuos adultos) con muy buenos resultados reproductivos.  Sin embargo, las actuales presiones generan perturbaciones que disminuyen en gran cantidad el nÃºmero de aves que nidifican aÃ±o a aÃ±o y se deben principalmente a perturbaciones durante la conquista del nido y la postura del huevo.   Es la Ãºnica zona de nidificaciÃ³n de esta especie en la zona continental de Chile Central. SÃ³lo existe registro de una colonia similar en Mejillones (zona norte) donde la colonia se vio fuertemente reducida por el paso de senderos peatonales y vehiculares en sus cercanÃ­as.","Propuesta de zonificaciÃ³n para la conservaciÃ³n del Piquero comÃºn: ChinchimÃ©n a creado una propuesta de zonificaciÃ³n para hacer frente a los proyectos inmobiliarios con el de fin de poder contar con algÃºn referente que puedan utilizar las autoridades al momento de las instancias de toma de decisiÃ³n.   Ãrea de prohibiciÃ³n de Vuelo: Se ha recurrido a la DirecciÃ³n General de AeronÃ¡utica Civil (DGAC) para con una peticiÃ³n de declarar un Ã¡rea de prohibiciÃ³n de vuelo tanto para aeronaves a motor como de parapentes y alas delta. Sin embargo, se dice que no existen los instrumentos para poder conservar  el espacio aÃ©reo para la conservaciÃ³n de la especie. Actualmente el Grupo de AcciÃ³n EcolÃ³gica ChinchimÃ©n se encuentra buscando distintas alternativas para lograr este punto dentro de las cuales es identificar experiencias de jurisprudencias relacionadas. AdemÃ¡s se ha tomado contacto con las torres de control para generar conciencia en  los funcionarios sobre la conservaciÃ³n de este espacio.   Denuncias:  ChinchimÃ©n se encuentra visitante frecuentemente el Ã¡rea y generando las denuncias pertinentes cuando estas sean necesarias. Sin embargo, el problema mayor es que se aborda el problema posterior al impacto. Aunque se espera con esto las inmobiliarias mejoren sus  prÃ¡cticas.   Instrumentos de PlanificaciÃ³n: Incesantemente ChinchimÃ©n se encuentra participando de todas las instancias de planificaciÃ³n urbana para aportar con la conservaciÃ³n de la colonia.   Sistema de evaluaciÃ³n de impacto ambiental: ChinchimÃ©n participa de las evaluaciones de impacto ambiental que afectan a la colonia poniendo en evidencia las faltas cometidas por la empresa privada.   Monitoreo de  la colonia de piqueros: Desde el aÃ±o 2009 se han realizado dos censos poblaciones de la colonia lo que ha permitido identificar los sitios de mayor importancia y dejar la constancia de la existencia de nidos para prevenir las omisiones de los estudios realizados por privados en pos de los proyectos inmobiliarios.   EducaciÃ³n: Se realizan programas educativos con escuelas de la comuna para inculcar la conciencia de conservaciÃ³n en la poblaciÃ³n local, aunque las principales amenazas son externas la educaciÃ³n local permitirÃ¡ en un futuro prevenir algunos impactos.",126193,confirmed,2010,,A4ii,0,-,,,

Animales domÃ©sticos (ratas, perros, gatos y ganado): depredan y pisotean sobre la nidificaciÃ³n de diferentes especies.   Carencia de medidas efectivas de protecciÃ³n desde la educaciÃ³n, investigaciÃ³n y participaciÃ³n ciudadana: esto se ha traducido en falencia por parte de las comunidades locales en el nulo o poco conocimiento de las funciones ambientales de este humedal y la escasa participaciÃ³n de las comunidades locales en los procesos de toma de decisiones.   ContaminaciÃ³n de todo tipo: en el sitio ocurren en diferentes sectores microbasurales, descarga de aceites y derivados del petrÃ³leo, plÃ¡sticos de todo tipo en el humedal especialmente en la zona de Playa de la BahÃ­a de ConcepciÃ³n, residuos domiciliarios.","State of key populations:  El Humedal Marisma Rocuant-Andalien (IBA 25107) alberga y mantiene a mÃ¡s del 1% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial de varias especies migratorias que nidifican en NorteamÃ©rica, entre las cuales se congregan en grandes nÃºmeros y utilizan el humedal como sitio de invernada para descansar y alimentarse. De acuerdo a lo anterior el Humedal Rocuant-AndaliÃ©n ha sido reconocido a nivel mundial como una IBA bajo los criterios A1 y A4i acordados internacionalmente y con la informaciÃ³n local generada durante el proceso IBAs en Chile y los numerosos censos realizados en este sitio, dado que durante los meses de noviembre, diciembre, enero, febrero, marzo y abril el humedal concentra grandes poblaciones de aves migratorias neotropicales  Criterio A1: El humedal concentra regularmente umbrales adecuados para las especies Sterna elegans y Pelecanus thagus ambas especies consideradas por BirdLife Intrnational como especies  Casi Amenazadas (NT).  Critierio A4i: El humedal concentra al 2.4% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial de la especie Leucophaeus pipixcan, pero durante periodos de migraciÃ³n puede albergar mucho mÃ¡s: en marzo de 2008 se contabilizÃ³ 28% de su poblaciÃ³n global (P. Ortiz, com. pers.), 2.3% de Numenius phaeopus y el 4.3% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial de la especie Sterna elegans (Censos e Informe final Ãreas Importantes para la ConservaciÃ³n de las Aves de Chile, CODEFF-BirdLife International).  AdemÃ¡s de lo anterior y de acuerdo a los censos simultÃ¡neos realizados entre los meses de abril y mayo, el humedal concentra al 1.8% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial de la especie Rhynchops niger  y al 1% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial de Sterna trudeaui (Umbrales congregatorias BirdLife International).   State of key habitats:  El humedal posee una superficie de mÃ¡s de 1.500 hectareas, es un humedal con caracterÃ­sticas de estuario intermareal tipo marisma con influencia ribereÃ±a permanente y temporal. La marisma Rocuant se ubica en el sector suroeste de la bahÃ­a de ConcepciÃ³n y se comunica con el mar a travez del canal el Morro, la marisma AndalieÂ´n corresponde a la desembocadura del rÃ­o AndaliÃ©n ubicada en el sureste de la bahÃ­a de ConcepciÃ³n, en esta zona el rÃ­o forma un estuario que atraviesa estensos sectores de humedales inundables durante el invierno. Este gran humedal se ha fraccionado en las Ãºltimas cuatro dÃ©cadas quedando fragmentado y muy degradado. En este humedal se encuentran alrededor de 110 especies de aves que buscan aquÃ­ alimentaciÃ³n, refugio y reproducciÃ³n. Entre las aves nidificantes se pueden encontrar al PilpilÃ©n (, Perrito, Cisne de cuello negro, cisne coscocroba, BailarÃ­n chico, piden, siete colores, Trabajador, Pato cuchara entre otras, entre las especies migratorias neaticas se concentran en grandes nÃºmeros (mÃ¡s del 1% de la poblaciÃ³n mundial) a la Gaviota de Frankln (Larus pipixcan), GaviotÃ­n elegante (Steran elegans), Zarapito comÃºn (Nemenius phaepus), Rayador (Niger, y entre las aves migratorias australes al Chorlo Chileno (), Chorlo nevado, Gaviota cahuil entre otras.","Si existen acciones de conservaciÃ³n por parte de CODEFF y de organizaciones sociales locales como talleres de educaciÃ³n ambiental, censos y trabajo con la autoridad ambiental local.

Si bien existe una gran extensiÃ³n de bosques en buen estado de conservaciÃ³n, la explotaciÃ³n maderera, minerÃ­a y el cultivo de palma africana, ha hecho que una importante proporciÃ³n del Ã¡rea estÃ© cubierta por bosques alterados o zonas totalmente degradadas..","Las presiones polÃ­ticas y sociales dificultan la ejecuciÃ³n de cualquier acciÃ³n o estrategia de conservaciÃ³n en el Ã¡rea, sin embargo hay comunidades (Playa de Oro) que siguen interesadas y comprometidas con el desarrollo de proyectos de conservaciÃ³n y desarrollo sostenible.

State of the habitats of the trigger species: La BahÃ­a de AsunciÃ³n, asentada sobre un banco arenoso, el â€œBanco San Miguelâ€, constituye un antiguo meandro del rÃ­o Paraguay aislado paulatinamente del curso principal. Contiene cuerpos de aguas permanentes y semi-permanentes cuya profundidad y extensiÃ³n varÃ­an con las fluctuaciones hidrolÃ³gicas anuales, alternÃ¡ndose fases de suelo seco y de suelo inundado, conocidas como pulsos. Actualmente el Banco San Miguel ha sido modificado en gran parte por el dragado y relleno con arena del lecho del rio con fines de construcciÃ³n de una avenida. El hÃ¡bitat para las especies migratorias ha sido destruido en su mayor parte. La vegetaciÃ³n de la bahÃ­a estÃ¡ condicionada principalmente por el rÃ©gimen de fluctuaciÃ³n del agua y por la disponibilidad de nutrientes. La franja mÃ¡s cercana a los cuerpos de agua, denominada planicie proximal, recibe inundaciones una o mÃ¡s veces al aÃ±o (TNC et al. 2005). AquÃ­ la vegetaciÃ³n es muy dinÃ¡mica ya que avanza o retrocede acompaÃ±ando a los pulsos y se halla colonizada por plantas palustres de rÃ¡pido crecimiento, predominan especies de los gÃ©neros Heliotropium, Portulaca, Polygonum e Hymenachne, ademÃ¡s de varias ciperÃ¡ceas y gramÃ­neas. En el litoral de los espejos de agua la vegetaciÃ³n se distribuye en parches de plantas acuÃ¡ticas; sobresalen la lechuguita de agua (P. stratiotes), los helechos de agua (Azolla y Salvinia) y los camalotes (E. crassipes, E. azurea y Pontederia cordata), entre otras especies de acuÃ¡ticas flotantes y sumergidas. A medida que uno se aleja de la lÃ­nea del agua, van apareciendo malezas leÃ±osas de humedales como aromita (A. caven), mandyju ra (Ipomoea carnea sub. fistulosa), jukery (Mimosa pigra), duraznillos de agua (Ludwigia spp.) y Discolobium pulchellum. Ya en la planicie de desborde fluvial, el flujo del agua ha modelado albardones arenosos vegetados por bosques abiertos de hasta 15-20 m (TNC et al. 2005), dominados por unas pocas especies como mbavy (Banara arguta), ingÃ¡ (Inga vera sub. affinis), sangre de drago (Croton urucurana), yacarÃ© pito (A. chacoensis), tapiâ€™a (Crataeva tapia) y timbo blanco (A. inundata)..","Es una de las pocas Ã¡reas protegidas declaradas bajo Ley de la NaciÃ³n (NÂ° 2.715/05) como â€œReserva EcolÃ³gicaâ€ correspondiente a la categorÃ­a IV de la UICN, bajo el dominio de la Municipalidad de AsunciÃ³n.",114401,confirmed,2007,,"A1, A4i",0,-,,,

La vegetaciÃ³n predominante en Laguna Blanca corresponde al Cerrado, con sabanas claras y cobertura leÃ±osa de hasta 40% desarrolladas sobre suelos muy sueltos, arenosos, Ã¡cidos y bien drenados. El estrato herbÃ¡ceo estÃ¡ constituido por gramÃ­neas, acompaÃ±adas por herbÃ¡ceas bulbosas (liliÃ¡ceas), herbÃ¡ceas tuberosas (asterÃ¡ceas, apocinÃ¡ceas, euforbiÃ¡ceas) y sufrÃºtices (mirtÃ¡ceas, leguminosas). Entre los Ã¡rboles y arbustos dispersos se destacan los de porte achaparrado y cortezas corchosas como paratodo (T. aurea), morosyvo (A. peregrina), mangay (H. speciosa), lorito pysa (D. mollis) y jataâ€™i (B. paraguayensis) (Guyra Paraguay 2002). En la cercanÃ­a de los cursos de agua, sobre suelos saturados permanentemente, desaparece la cobertura leÃ±osa para dar lugar a pastizales o campos limpios dominados por gramÃ­neas, ciperÃ¡ceas y especies de los gÃ©neros Eryngium, Eriocaulon, Drosera, Licopodiella, entre otros (MarÃ­n et al. 1998). Sobre las colinas del terreno, tambiÃ©n sobre suelos arenosos generalmente bien drenados, se desarrollan cerradones, bosques densos de hasta 15 m con caracterÃ­sticas xeromÃ³rficas, que representan sistemas transicionales entre los bosques mesofÃ­ticos y las sabanas (Josse et al. 2003). EstÃ¡n constituidos por un dosel continuo en donde predominan Ã¡rboles de jatayva (Hymenaea coubaril), paratodo, pata de buey (Bauhinia sp.), palo de vino (V. tocanorum), canelÃ³n (Rapanea sp.), pequi (C. brasiliense) y tatare moroti (G. polymorpha), mientras que en el sotobosque domina el espartillo (E. muticus) (Guyra Paraguay, 2002; 2004). Isletas de Bosque AtlÃ¡ntico transicional con el Cerrado se desarrollan al Sur y Sureste de la propiedad (Josse et al. 2003). Estas isletas boscosas, caracterizadas por especies como lapacho (T. heptaphylla), cedro (C. fissilis), cancharana (C. canjerana), guatambu (B. riedelianum), mandyju ra (P. tomentosum), morosyvo (A. peregrina) y urundeâ€™y para (A. fraxinifolium), han sufrido una sobreexplotaciÃ³n selectiva; los mayores indicios de tala de Ã¡rboles y desmontes se registran del lado Sur de la Laguna, prÃ¡ctica realizada para la habilitaciÃ³n de tierras con fines de uso agropecuario. En la parte sur del IBA en los alrededores de la laguna Blanca el hÃ¡bitat ha sufrido grandes modificaciones, en la propiedad llamada Laguna Blanca que era la frecuentada para monitoreo y la que dio origen al IBA, ya no queda hÃ¡bitat apropiado para las especies amenazadas. El hÃ¡bitat que las especies amenazadas prefieren se encuentra reducida a unas 200 Ha fuera de la propiedad, esta parcela se encuentra en la propiedad de la empresa Forestal RÃ­o Verde que se encuentra implantando eucaliptus, es un Ã¡rea de campo limpio sobre suelo saturado en la vertiente del arroyo Clementina, los demÃ¡s sitios cercanos a la laguna en donde las especies amenazadas eran monitoreadas han sido totalmente perdidos por la implantaciÃ³n de pasturas (unas 400 Ha). Solo queda proteger esas Ãºltimas 200 Ha de la implantaciÃ³n de eucaliptus y buscar otras Ã¡reas apropiadas dentro de la superficie del IBA para protegerlas..","Toda la tierra dentro del IBA es de propiedad privada, el nÃºcleo Laguna Blanca de 2.449 Ha creado una reserva privada de 800 Ha pero que ya no protege ninguna especie amenazada y ha dejado de tener sentido, existe hÃ¡bitat remanente con las especies amenazadas en propiedades vecinas dentro del IBA de unas 31.000 Ha con 18.000 Ha de cerrado y hay que trabajar con estos propietarios o comprar propiedades para dedicarlas a la conservaciÃ³n.",114879,confirmed,2007,,"A1, A3",0,-,,,

Los bosques de San Rafael son densos, semicaducifolios y de altura variable de un sector a otro entre 20 y 30 m, debido al grado de intensidad de extracciÃ³n maderera al que fueron sometidos en el pasado. Los pastizales o campos de San Rafael tambiÃ©n albergan una gran diversidad de fauna y flora. Los pastizales son comunidades predominantemente herbÃ¡ceas desarrolladas sobre suelos de textura limo-arcillosa, con una cobertura de leÃ±osas arbustivas y arbÃ³reas dispersas; son comunes especies como tembetary mi (Fagara rhoifolia), burro kaâ€™a (Casearia silvestres), yva hai (Hexachlamys edulis), aratikuâ€™i (Rollinia emarginata), aguai (Chrysophyllum gonocarpum) y pykasu rembiâ€™u (C. marginatum). Las gramÃ­neas dominan el paisaje llano junto con otras herbÃ¡ceas de las familias Apiaceae, Fabaceae, Melastomataceae, Rubiaceae, Asteraceae, Amaranthaceae, entre otras. Los pastizales sobre suelos saturados, que pueden llegar a alcanzar hasta 2 m de altura, se encuentran asociados a nacientes y valles de arroyos. La cobertura leÃ±osa desaparece dando lugar al predominio de gramÃ­neas, ciperÃ¡ceas, juncÃ¡ceas, onagrÃ¡ceas y otras hierbas palustres. A medida que el terreno desciende, los pastizales se convierten en esteros permanentes que favorecen el desarrollo de una gran diversidad de plantas acuÃ¡ticas..","En principio se acepta la categorÃ­a de manejo Parque Nacional (CategorÃ­a II), creado por Decreto NÂº 13.680 en 1992. Sin embargo, existen varios otros decretos que crean gran confusiÃ³n sobre su figura. Hasta la fecha existen varias propiedades que hacen caso omiso de las restricciones de la figura impuesta sobre ellas. El Ã¡rea no tiene planes o programa de manejos operativos, salvo en las Ã¡reas de reserva adquiridas por Guyra Paraguay (que consisten en varias fincas dentro del Ã¡rea del Parque). El Proyecto GEF Paraguay Silvestre estÃ¡ implementando ciertas acciones especialmente en el Ã¡rea de amortiguamiento. La ONG denominada Procosara realiza un trabajo destacado de control y vigilancia en el Ã¡rea y cuenta con un cuerpo de guardabosques. La ONG denominada â€œPromotores Ambientalesâ€, de Caronay, Alto VerÃ¡, tambiÃ©n se encuentra trabajando con programas de educaciÃ³n y combate a incendios",114394,confirmed,2007,,"A1, A2, A3, A4ii",0,-,,,

Las mÃ¡rgenes y playas fluviales de los brazos activos del rÃ­o, inundadas en parte del aÃ±o, son colonizados por especies pioneras de rÃ¡pido crecimiento capaces de constituir bosques bajos o matorrales generalmente dominados por una sola especie. Se denominan bobales, cuando la especie dominante es el palobobo (T. integrifolia) y chaÃ±arales cuando domina el chaÃ±ar (G. decorticans). En ocasiones se encuentran asociadas con otras especies hidrÃ³filas como sauce (Salix humboldtiana), aromito (A. aroma), kurupikaâ€™y (S. haematospermum), acacia negra (S. virgata), jukeri (Mimosa pigra) y ancoche (V. glabra) (TNC et al. 2005, Spichiger et al. 1991). En los aÃ±os 2004 y 2005 el estero PatiÃ±o volviÃ³ a regarse de agua luego de 14 aÃ±os de extrema sequÃ­a, pero ese periodo de grandes inundaciones duro poco, luego de ocho aÃ±os ya para el 2012 las aguas del rÃ­o Pilcomayo subiÃ³ hasta la zona del estero, fue tanta la cantidad de agua que dificulto el acceso para realizar monitoreos..",En la actualidad no existen proyectos de conservaciÃ³n o planes de manejos para realizar acciones de conservaciÃ³n en el sitio.,114887,confirmed,2007,,"A1, A3, A4i, A4iii",0,-,,,
