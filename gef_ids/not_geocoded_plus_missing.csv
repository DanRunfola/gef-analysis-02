The country is politically divided into 24 provinces, one of which, the Province of Napo, constitutes the Project’s intervention area. The Province of Napo has a population of 103,697 inhabitants, 56% of which is rural (57,859 inhabitants). The levels of poverty in the province are high; 77.1% of the population is poor, while 42.8% is extremely poor. Agricultural activities and extraction of timber are the only source of income in rural areas and at the same time, they are the key factors that jeopardize the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions.    The intervention areas are located in the buffer zones of the protected areas of the province. The vision is to establish biological corridors by implementing conservation activities in community and private properties (Appendix 7). Sustainable livestock production practices will be fostered in the highlands of the province, while in the lowlands the project will seek to strengthen the cocoa sustainable production corridor, and the commercialization of biodiversity products. Best production practices of clean naranjilla will be promoted in the area between the two sectors of the Sumaco Napo Galeras National Park. Sustainable community-based ecotourism will be promoted in these same areas. These actions are expected to provide rural communities with opportunities for income generation, hence reducing their poverty and at the same time conserving and recovering the ecosystem services of local, national and global significance. The proposed solutions for the province are potentially replicable in other Amazonian provinces and the Andean-Amazonian pre-montane areas of Ecuador.

Annex 2: Description of priority areas    The UPAF (Upper Parana Atlantic Forest) in Paraguay originally covered a significant portion of the Eastern Region, stretching over the whole of the Departments of Alto Parana, Canindeyu, Itapua and Caaguazu, a large share of the Departments of Amambay, San Pedro, Guairá and Caazapa, and parts of the Departments of Concepcion and Paraguari (map in Annex 2). The original coverage has been estimated at 94,000 km2 or 58.8% of the region´s surface area. Today the forest remnants are estimated at 26% of the original cover, most significantly in the departments of Alto Paraná, Amambay and Canindeyú, where an important diversity of habitats with a high degree of threats converge, and constitute the project´s intervention area.    The project intervention area comprises the Departments of Alto Paraná, Amambay and Canindeyu, located to the East and Northeast of the Eastern Region, bordering with Brazil and Argentina (map in Annex 2). Their total surface area of 42,495 km2 represents 26.5% of the Eastern Region´s surface and 10% of the country.    The Alto Parana priority area stretches across the area of influence of the Monday and Ñacunday rivers (see map in Annex 2); it has an extension of 549,160 ha with 16% forest cover (87,000 ha, including 5,312 ha of protected areas). The area spans across 13 Municipalities (Juan E. O’leary, Juan León Mallorquín, Yguazu, MingaGuazu, Santa Rosa del Monday, Santa Rita, San Cristóbal, Presidente Franco, Cedrales, Domingo Martínez de Irala, Ñacunday, Iruña and Naranjal) and has a rural population of 48,687. Indigenous communities of the Mbya, Ava Guarania and Ache are located within the area. The main land use is mechanized agriculture largely for the production of commodities (soy, maize, wheat) covering 78% of the area´s surface area (430,945 ha). The area´s potential lies in the possibility of increasing connectivity through restoration of protective forests of watercourses and the presence of strengthened institutions such as cooperatives, which in recent years have shown an increasing interest in complying with the environmental regulations.    The Amambay priority area is located in the area of influence of the Cerro Cora National Park (see map in Annex 2). The area stretches across 582,927 ha and 2 districts (Pedro Juan Caballero and Capitan Bado); its rural population is 12,928. The forest cover of the area amounts to 171,846 ha or 30% of its surface area. Key criteria for selection of this area were the richness of its flora, cultural significance, and the need to strengthen SEAM´s presence in the region. The main land use is livestock production covering 358,208 ha or 61% of the area´s surface area. Indigenous communities in the region include Mbya, Ava Guarani and Pai Tavytera. The main threats to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity include: 1) contamination and sedimentation of watercourses; 2) burning of pastures; 4) soil erosion; 5) invasion of exotic species (pastures) and 6) expansion of illegal crops.    The Canindeyu priority area is located within the area of influence of the Mbaracayu Forest Biosphere Reserve, which has a surface area of 289,506 ha. The Mbaracayu Forest Reserve is located within the area and is the largest protected forest remnant in the East of Paraguay (64,000 ha). The area stretches across most of the district of Villa Ygatimi and partially over the districts of Ypehu, Corpus Christi, Curuguaty and Katuete (see map in Annex 2). The rural population of these districts is 41,305. Forests within the area (outside of protected areas) cover 65,122 ha or 22% of the surface area. Although livestock production is the main land use in the Department of Canindeyu, within the area the main land use is agriculture due to the high presence of small farmers; 67% of the properties are larger than 100 ha while 33% are smaller. Agriculture covers 105,855 ha or 37% of the area´s surface area. Indigenous peoples include Ache, Ava Guarani, PaiTavytera and Mbya, some of them conserving important forest areas, such as the Ache community of ChupaPou, who own some 8,000 ha of forests. The main threats to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in this area are: 1) Unsustainable agricultural and livestock practices; 2) Unsustainable forestry; 3) Settlements established without adequate planning; 4) expansion of illegal crops.",,,,CEO-endorsed/approved document,"priority area- SFM, SLM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are three types of forest: sclerophyllous forest (hard leaf species such as quillay, boldo, peumo, litre, espino, maitén); deciduous forest (oak, hualo); and scrub and thorn forest (predominantly hard leaf shrubs resistant to heat and drought as espino). Land use is 29% agricultural, 37% meadows and thickets, 25% native forest and 1.6% poplar plantations. The population is highly urban in Doñihue, moderately urban in Las Cabras and heavily rural in Coltauco (rural 5.04%, 26.92% and 72.32%, respectively). The diversity of flora is high with 1,189 species (908 native and 281 introduced), 23.3% of the national flora. Several local species present conservation problems and are classified as endangered such as the Avellanita and Belloto del Sur; vulnerable, such as the Belloto del Norte, Hualo, Llaretilla, Guayacán, the Chilean Palm and the Lingue del Norte; and rare, such as the Huillipatagua, Maiten de Chubut, Petrillo and Arrayán de Hoja Roja. The ecosystems of scrubland and sclerophyll forest particularly stand out, rich in endemic species and many of them are species with limited distribution (Laurelia sempervirens, Beilschmiedia berteroana, Porlieria chilensis, Prosopis chilensis) or rare (Avellanita bustillosii, Myrceugenia colchaguensis, Leucocoryne popetana, Dasyphyllum excelsum, Eriosyce aspillagai).

These communities were selected based on: (1) proximity to and impact on degradation of habitat and ecosystem services in protected areas (the Annandale Forest Reserve within the watershed and/or the two MPAs downstream of the watershed), particularly soil erosion, sedimentation and forest encroachment; (2) potential benefits for local livelihoods; and (3) community capacity and/or experience with previous conservation activities. Interventions using sustainable agricultural practices are intended to reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, to minimize land degradation, erosion and deforestation, and to create sustainable alternative livelihood opportunities for local inhabitants.   110. In the short-term, the site level work in the six communities will test and demonstrate different avoidance, reduction and rehabilitation work under the auspices of Sustainable Agricultural Production, including: soil conservation practices (use of vegetative strips; cover crops; contour farming; minimum soil tillage); water management practices (rain water harvesting; improved drainage and storm water control); and sustainable soil enrichment practices (increased use of organic matter; reduced use of inorganic fertilizers) in an area of up to 132.4 hectares of existing cropland (as well as some currently abandoned agricultural land) and with the participation of up to 400 farmers. Activities in these communities will also include apiculture (introduction of improved breeding stock; procurement of 250 hives for sale to beekeepers) with up to 50 participants. Sustainable livestock management will focus on protection measures for riparian zones (up to 210 hectares), including assessment of grazing impacts/carrying capacities; fencing; and monitoring and enforcement of grazing regulations. Sustainable forest management practices will include the re-vegetation of 150 hectares of highly-degraded land (where forest cover was almost completely removed by hurricane impacts) with enrichment planting using agro-forestry crops (recommended plant species include nutmeg, cocoa, mangoes, soursop, sugar apple, breadfruit, breadnut, coconuts, cinnamon, clove; governor plum, pomerac, pommecytherre, bois bande, passion fruit, pineapples and pomegranate).

There is no separate section for project site.   Establishment of Songkhla Lake Basin EPA (including Thale Noi NHA and other areas)  Establishment of Kuan Kreng EPA (including Bor Lor NHA and other areas)    The correct title of the type of protected area to be established in the Kuan Kreng Landscape (KKL) is Environmental Protection Area (EPA) and not Environmental Conservation Area (ECA), according to the NEQA law. Also, an EPA is an IUCN Category V protected area.  Further, at the time of the PIF it was felt that only one EPA could be established in the KKL. However, following discussions during the PPG phase and the ongoing developments with respect to establishment of the Songkhla Lake Basin EPA (part of which includes the Thale Noi NHA from the KKL), it was determined that the project should (1) support the community consultations necessary to secure establishment of the Songkhla Lake Basin EPA (128,000 ha and including the Thale Noi NHA), and (2) bring the remaining parts of the KKL under protection as the Kuan Kreng EPA (26,363 ha). Thus the total area to be brought under protection as EPAs is 154,363 ha.  The project will undertake designation of the Kuan Kreng EPA and Songkhla Lake EPA, developing management plans and zoning for the entire landscape of the EPAs, and undertaking targeted demonstrations (native forest reforestation, maintaining water levels, avoiding conversion to oil palm plantations, carbon flux monitoring) at some pilot sites. The land use planning and zoning approach is described in Output 1.2 and will consist of zoning the area into (1) core zone where only conventional uses that do not affect water levels will be allowed, (2) buffer zone where community forestry for local community use and management will be permitted, and (3) transition zone where residential and community areas will be permitted. In terms of monitoring the effectiveness of PA management, the METT has been used to set baselines and targets and monitor progress.

Intervention Area   The intervention area is the IFR, selected for meeting the following criteria: a) significant area of forest ecosystems, covering 3,821,900 ha; b) high level of biodiversity and endemism; c) important carbon stocks; d) presence of fragile soils; e) presence of drivers of forest deforestation and land degradation as a result of economic activities (agriculture, silvicultural practices, illegal logging and gold mining) for which there is no detailed and updated information; and f) presence of vulnerable forest-dependent groups.   In the IFR, the ENF has been granted the concession over 599,400 ha, distributed in several management units. One of these units is Unit Imataca V (Unit V) where the ENF has been developing its core operations since 2012. Unit V has been selected as the project´s priority site for demonstration interventions given that it is the management unit for which sufficient baseline information has been generated for the project to build upon. Unit V covers an area of 167,320 ha and is representative of the RFI; its natural wealth includes diverse ecosystems, natural and mineral resources and it has an important cultural value given the presence of indigenous peoples.     Unit V is located in the area of influence of the Sifontes municipality, which has a population of 70,000 inhabitants, of which 82% is urban.
