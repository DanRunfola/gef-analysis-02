  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "trusty64"
  # config.vm.box = "xenial64"

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8081
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5430, host: 6788

  # config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "setup/setup.sh"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true

    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4096"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
